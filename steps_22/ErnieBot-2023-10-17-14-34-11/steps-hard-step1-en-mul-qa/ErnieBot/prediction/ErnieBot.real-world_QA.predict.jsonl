The convention usually followed is the Z-Y-X sequence (Z, then Y, then X).\n\nIn this case, the first two digits [0. 0.] represent the rotation about the Z (heading) and Y (attitude) axes, which together define the orientation of the object in the horizontal plane. The third digit [0.] represents the rotation about the X (bank) axis, which determines how the object is tilted or banked.\n\nSo, the direction digits [0. 0. 0.] represent that there is no rotation about any of the axes, i.e., the object is pointing along the positive Z-axis, with zero bank angle and zero attitude angle.\n\nThe direction digits [0. 0. 1.] represent that there is no rotation about the Z and Y axes (i.e., heading and attitude are zero), but there is a rotation of 1 degree about the X axis (bank angle). Therefore, the object is pointing along the positive Z-axis, with zero bank angle and zero attitude angle, but there is a small rotation of 1 degree about the X axis.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is: \"The answer is therefore \"None\"\" since you did not ask any specific question.
