This is because the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\nTotal number of golf balls sold = Yellow golf balls sold + White golf balls sold\n\nSince the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that:\n\nTotal number of golf balls sold = Yellow golf balls sold\n\nNow, we can substitute the total number of golf balls sold from the equation above:\n\nYellow golf balls sold = White golf balls sold\n\nNow, let's use the information from the problem:\n\nTotal number of golf balls sold = 600 (initial number of golf balls) * 80% (sold) = 480\n\nSince the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that:\n\nYellow golf balls sold = White golf balls sold = 480 / 2 = 240\n\nNow, let's substitute the number of yellow and white golf balls sold into the original equation:\n\nYellow golf balls sold = 240\n\nSince the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that:\n\nWhite golf balls sold = 240\n\nNow, let's substitute the number of white golf balls sold into the equation:\n\nYellow golf balls sold = 240\n\nThe choice is therefore B: 120.", "prediction": "B: 120."}

They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again?\n\nFrom the background, we can see that the three bells have different intervals. To find the time when they will ring together again, we need to find the smallest common multiple (SCM) of the three intervals.\n\n36, 40, and 48 are all prime numbers, so there is no way to find a common multiple.

To win the election, a candidate needed to receive more than 50 percent of the vote, which is 50 * 2000 = 10,000 votes.\n\nThe difference between the votes James received and the votes needed to win is 10,000 - 100 = 9990.

Divide the age of the 15th student by 15: 18 years / 15 = 1.2 years\n\nHowever, the age of the 15th student cannot be a decimal. In this case, we can round up the age to the nearest whole number. The rounded-up age is 18 years, which is not an option in the list of choices.\n\nThe closest whole number to 1.2 years is 2 years, so we can round up the age of the 15th student to 18 years.\n\nThe choice is therefore B: 17 years."}

Since the company wants to spend equal amounts of money for both types of printers, the number of computer printers that the company can purchase is given by the formula: 750 / (400 + 350) = 750 / 750 = 1.
