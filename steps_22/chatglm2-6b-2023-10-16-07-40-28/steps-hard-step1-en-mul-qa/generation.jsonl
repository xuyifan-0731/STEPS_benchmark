These values are represented as a triplet, with each value ranging from 0 to 255. The RGB values can be used to calculate the color of any color by combining them in different ways. For example, a RGB value of (0, 0, 255) represents a color with all blue pixels, a RGB value of (255, 0, 0) represents a color with all red pixels, and so on.
