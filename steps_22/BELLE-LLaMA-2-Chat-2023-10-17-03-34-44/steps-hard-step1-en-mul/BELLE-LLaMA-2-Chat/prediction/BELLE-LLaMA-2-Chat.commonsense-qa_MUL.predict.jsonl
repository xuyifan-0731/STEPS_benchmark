Today's date is the work anniversary date, which is not explicitly given in the question, but we can assume it is the current date. Therefore, we can use the current date to calculate the date 10 days ago.\nIf today is November 22, 2022, then 10 days ago would be November 12, 2022. In MM/DD/YYYY format, this date would be written as 11/12/2022.\nHowever, if today is not November 22, 2022, we need to adjust the calculation accordingly. We can use the information that Jane started her job in 2016 to determine the year. If today is in 2022, then Jane has been working for 6 years. Therefore, we can subtract 6 years from the current year to get the year of Jane's work anniversary.\nFor example, if today is November 22, 2022, then Jane's work anniversary would be in 2016 + 6 = 2022. Therefore, the date 10 days ago would be November 12, 2022.\nIn summary, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is A:11/21/2019.", "prediction": "A:11/21/2019."}

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. After some interrogation, Alex finally confesses that he had told Benni that Tom wanted them to buy and use the chemical B Y33R instead of A X200R. He wanted Benni to use the wrong fertilizer and to get fired because he wanted to have more working hours to earn more money. He himself only used A X200R. Benni tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both gardeners to use A X200R.

Prof. Smith sends in her applications. Each committee meets independently and they decide without talking to each other, but their meetings are scheduled for the exact same time. The IT committee approves her application, and as expected, the department budget committee approves her application. So, Prof. Smith got her new computers. Does the department budget committee cause the approval of Prof. Smith's application?\n \noptions: \nA:No \nB:Yes \nAnswer: \n", "targets": ["B"], "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "raw_answer": "\n The choice is therefore A: No. \nThe department budget committee did not cause the approval of Prof. Smith's application. The IT committee approved her application, and since only one committee's approval was required, the department budget committee's approval was not necessary for her to get the new computers. The fact that the department budget committee almost always approves applications does not change this fact. Additionally, the fact that the committee meetings were scheduled for the same time does not imply any causal relationship between the two committees' decisions.", "prediction": "A: No."}

They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing dangerous viruses are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing dangerous viruses are deleted from the central computer.

Additionally, the company policy states that only one person is allowed to log into the central computer at a time in the afternoons, which suggests that the deletion was not caused by Suzy specifically. Therefore, the answer is A: No.", "prediction": "A: No."}
