We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so we can deduce that 90% of the chocolates are not cocoa flavored. Of those 90%, 9% are squashed, which means that 91% are not squashed. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 91% - 10% = 81%. Since we cannot have a fraction of a percentage, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 2%. Therefore, the answer is B: 2%.", "prediction": "B: 2%"}

This means that the store sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we can set up the equation: \nYellow golf balls sold = White golf balls sold \nWe also know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so we can substitute this into the equation: \nYellow golf balls sold = 480 \nSince the store had 600 golf balls at the beginning of the day, we can set up another equation: \nYellow golf balls at beginning of day + Yellow golf balls sold = Total yellow golf balls \nSubstituting the value of yellow golf balls sold from the previous equation, we get: \nYellow golf balls at beginning of day + 480 = Total yellow golf balls \nWe can solve for the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day by subtracting 480 from the total number of yellow golf balls: \nYellow golf balls at beginning of day = Total yellow golf balls - 480 \nSubstituting the value of total yellow golf balls from the first equation, we get: \nYellow golf balls at beginning of day = 480 \nTherefore, the store had 120 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.", "prediction": "B: 120."}

The formula for the number of ways to select k objects from n objects, where order does not matter, is C(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). In this case, we need to select 3 applicants from a pool of 16, including exactly one non-employee. Let's call the number of non-employee applicants x. Then, we have 3 choices for the non-employee applicant, and 13 choices for the other two applicants. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 applicants is C(16,3) = 16! / (3! * (16-3)!) = 560. However, we only want to count distinct groups of applicants, which means we need to subtract the number of groups that contain more than one non-employee applicant. There are C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15 distinct groups of two non-employee applicants, and C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20 distinct groups of three non-employee applicants.

This means that the shortest interval between the bells is 36 seconds, and the longest interval is 48 seconds. To determine when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the shortest interval between the bells that will result in them ringing together. \nThe shortest interval between the bells is 36 seconds, so we need to add 36 seconds to the time when the bells started ringing together to find when they will ring together again. If the bells started ringing together at time t, then they will ring together again at time t + 36 seconds. \nSince the bells ring at intervals of 36, 40, and 48 seconds, we can set up a proportion to find the time when the bells will ring together again: \n36/x = 40/y = 48/z \nwhere x, y, and z are the times between the bells ringing in seconds. \nSolving this proportion, we find that x = 12 minutes, y = 16 minutes, and z = 20 minutes. \nTherefore, the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

We can check each of these values to find the units digit of k^3/4000. \nFor k = 1, k^3/4000 = 1/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 4, k^3/4000 = 4/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 9, k^3/4000 = 9/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 16, k^3/4000 = 16/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 25, k^3/4000 = 25/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 36, k^3/4000 = 36/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 49, k^3/4000 = 49/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 64, k^3/4000 = 64/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 81, k^3/4000 = 81/4000 = 0.\nFor k = 121, k^3/4000 = 121/4000 = 0.\nTherefore, the units digit of k^3/4000 is ", "prediction": "D:54."}
