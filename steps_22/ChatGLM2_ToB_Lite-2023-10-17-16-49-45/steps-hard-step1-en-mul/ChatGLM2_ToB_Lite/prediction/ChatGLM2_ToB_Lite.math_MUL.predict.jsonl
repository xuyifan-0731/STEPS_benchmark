Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, the next time the bells will ring together will be after 124 seconds / 60 seconds / minute = 2 minutes 14 seconds.

To find the sum, we can start by trying to figure out what the individual squares of the integers add up to.\n\nLet\\'s say the three integers are x, y, and z. Then we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 150\n\nWe can start by trying to find some patterns in the number. One way to do this is to look at the prime factors of 150. These are the numbers that are divisible by 150 and can be used to represent 150. The prime factors of 150 are:\n\n2, 3, and 5\n\nWe can then use these prime factors to try to break down the equation. Let\\'s say we want to try to find x, y, and z as powers of these prime factors.\n\nFor example, we might try x = 2^a, y = 3^b, and z = 5^c. If we can find some values of a, b, and c that satisfy the equation, then we have found a solution.\n\nHowever, it is not easy to find such values. One way to do it is to use the \\\"Chain Rule\\\" ofExponential Calculus. This rule allows us to express the sum of the squares of multiple integers as a single exponential.\n\nFor example, we have:\n\n(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2xz\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n150 = 2xy + 2yz + 2xz\n\nThis equation is very similar to the original equation, but it has one more term. This term is equal to 2 times the sum of the products of the variables x, y, and z. This can be expressed as:\n\n2xy + 2yz + 2xz = 2 \\* (xy + yz + xz)\n\n= 2 \\* (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\n= 2 \\* 150\n\n= 300\n\nSubstituting this back into the original equation, we get:\n\n150 = 300 - 2xy - 2yz - 2xz\n\n= -2xy - 2yz - 2xz + 300\n\n= -2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 300\n\n= -2 \\* 150 + 300\n\n= 100\n\nThis means that the sum of the squares of the three integers is 100. However, this is not a very satisfying answer because it does not give us the individual integers themselves.\n\nTo find the individual integers, we can solve for x, y, and z using the equation:\n\n-2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 300 = 100\n\n-2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = -100\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 50\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 50\n\nThis equation has many possible solutions, but one that is particularly simple is x = 5, y = 10, and z = 10.\n\nIn fact, this solution checks out. If we plug these values into the original equation, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 = 150\n\nTherefore, the choice is \\\"C: 15\\\".", "prediction": "C"}

Since k is a positive integer, k^2 must be at least 3^2 = 9.\n\nThe units digit of k^3 / 4000 can be calculated by taking the remainder of k^3 / 4000 when divided by 10.\n\nk^3 / 4000 = k(k^2 / 4000) = k(1/125) = k / 125\n\nThe remainder of k / 125 when divided by 10 is (k / 125) % 10 = k % 125.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of k^3 / 4000 is (k % 125).\n\nSince k is at least 9, the units digit of k % 125 is at most 9.
