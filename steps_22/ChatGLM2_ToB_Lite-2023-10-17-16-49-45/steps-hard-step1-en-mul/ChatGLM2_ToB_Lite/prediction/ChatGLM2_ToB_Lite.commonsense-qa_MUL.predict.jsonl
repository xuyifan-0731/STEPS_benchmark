If she ate one egg per day and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then she will have eaten 9 eggs. If the day she ran out of eggs was 10 days ago and she had eaten 9 eggs, then 10 days ago she had eaten 9 - 10 = -1 egg. Since she ate negative one egg, it means she had eaten 9 - 1 = 8 eggs before running out of eggs. If she ate 8 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten 8 - 10 = -2 eggs. Since she ate negative two eggs, it means she had eaten 8 - 2 = 6 eggs before running out of eggs. If she ate 6 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten 6 - 10 = -4 eggs. Since she ate negative four eggs, it means she had eaten 6 - 4 = 2 eggs before running out of eggs. If she ate 2 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten 2 - 10 = -8 eggs. Since she ate negative eight eggs, it means she had eaten 2 - 8 = -6 eggs before running out of eggs. If she ate -6 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -6 - 10 = -16 eggs. Since she ate negative 十六 eggs, it means she had eaten -16 - 10 = -26 eggs. Since she ate -26 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -26 - 10 = -36 eggs. Since she ate negative 三十六 eggs, it means she had eaten -36 - 10 = -46 eggs. Since she ate -46 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -46 - 10 = -56 eggs. Since she ate negative 56 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -56 - 10 = -66 eggs. Since she ate negative 66 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -66 - 10 = -76 eggs. Since she ate negative 76 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -76 - 10 = -86 eggs. Since she ate negative 86 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -86 - 10 = -96 eggs. Since she ate negative 96 eggs before running out of eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten -96 - 10 = -106 eggs. If the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten 86 - 106 = -20 eggs. Since she ate negative 20 eggs and the day she ran out of eggs was May 9th, 2017 then 10 days ago she had eaten 20 - 10 = 10 eggs. The choice is therefore {[C]}: 05/15/2017.", "prediction": "C"}

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. After some interrogation, Alex finally confesses that he had told Benni that Tom wanted them to buy and use the chemical B Y33R instead of A X200R. He wanted Benni to use the wrong fertilizer and to get fired because he wanted to have more working hours to earn more money. He himself only used A X200R. Benni tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both gardeners to use A X200R.
