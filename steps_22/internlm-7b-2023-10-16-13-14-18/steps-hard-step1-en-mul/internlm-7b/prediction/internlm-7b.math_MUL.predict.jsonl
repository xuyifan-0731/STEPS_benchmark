Since there are 10 chocolates that are cocoa flavored, there must be 90 - 10 = 80 chocolates that are vanilla flavored. \nNow, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Since there are 80 chocolates that are vanilla flavored, there must be 80 / 100 = 80% of chocolates that are vanilla flavored. \nSince there are 10 chocolates that are cocoa flavored, there must be 10 / 100 = 10% of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. \nTherefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 80% + 10% = 90%. \nThe answer is 90%. \nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nThe choice is therefore E\nThe answer is: 10%\n\nQuestion: A group of 6 people went to a restaurant for dinner.

We know that he spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. We can find the income by dividing the savings by the saving percentage. \nThe saving percentage is 12.5%, so we divide 12.5% by 100 to get 0.125.

We know that x + y = 3.40/20 = 0.17. We also know that x + y = 3.40/25 = 0.144. We can see that the two equations are not equal, so we can't use them to solve for x and y. However, we can use the first equation to solve for x. We know that x must be an integer, so x must be 0, 1, 2, or 3. If x = 0, then y = 3.40/20 = 0.17, which is not an integer. If x = 1, then y = 3.40/20 - 1 = 0.17 - 0.20 = -0.03, which is not an integer. If x = 2, then y = 3.40/20 - 2 = 0.17 - 0.40 = -0.23, which is not an integer. If x = 3, then y = 3.40/20 - 3 = 0.17 - 0.40 = -0.23, which is not an integer.

Then, 150 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2. Since 150 is a square, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 must be a square. Let it be t^2. Then, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = t^2. Now, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is a positive integer, so t^2 must also be a positive integer. Since t^2 is a square, t must be an integer. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = t^2 = 150. Thus, x + y + z = 150/3 = 50. So, the sum of the three integers is 13.\nThe answer is 13\n\nQuestion: A group of 10 people are standing in a line.

First, we need to find the total number of handshakes. There are 10 people in the group, so each person shakes hands with 9 people (including themselves). Therefore, there are a total of 10 * 9 = 90 handshakes. However, there are also 10 people who shake hands with themselves, so we need to subtract these 10 handshakes from the total. Therefore, there are a total of 90 - 10 = 80 handshakes. The answer is 80.\nThe answer is 80\n\nQuestion: A store owner has 200 apples.
