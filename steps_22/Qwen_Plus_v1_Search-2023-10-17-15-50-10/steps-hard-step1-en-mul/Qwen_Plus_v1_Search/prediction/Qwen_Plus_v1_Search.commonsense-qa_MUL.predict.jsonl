This gives us Jan 2, 1963. \n\nOne week from today would be 7 days after Jan 2, 1963, which is Jan 9, 1963. However, since we are looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to adjust for the fact that Jan 9, 1963 falls on a Sunday, which is a non-working day. Therefore, we need to add one day to the date to get the next working day, which is Monday, Jan 10, 1963. \n\nSince we are looking for the date one week from today, we need to subtract 7 days from Jan 10, 1963, which gives us Jan 3, 1963. However, since Jan 3, 1963 falls on a Tuesday, which is a non-working day, we need to subtract one day to get the previous working day, which is Monday, Jan 2, 1963. \n\nFinally, we need to add 7 days to Jan 2, 1963 to get the date one week from today, which is Jan 9, 1963. However, since Jan 9, 1963 falls on a Sunday, we need to add one day to the date to get the next working day, which is Monday, Jan 10, 1963. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: 01/16/1961.", "prediction": "A: 01/16/1961."}

The students did not cheat on the test. One student, John Granger, went along with the group. Granger follows the local norm and does not cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D.

He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. After some interrogation, Alex finally confesses that he had told Benni that Tom wanted them to buy and use the chemical B Y33R instead of A X200R. He wanted Benni to use the wrong fertilizer and to get fired because he wanted to have more working hours to earn more money. He himself only used A X200R. Benni tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both gardeners to use A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners.
