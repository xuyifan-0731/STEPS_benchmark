We also know that exactly one of the applicants who is not a present employee of the company must be selected, so we can choose this applicant in 15 ways (since there are 15 non-present employees). Once we have chosen this applicant, we need to select the remaining two applicants from the remaining 15 applicants (including the present employees).

On the other hand, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] can take on any value between 2 and 4, inclusive.

Since k^2 is divisible by both 45 and 80, it must be divisible by their greatest common factor, which is 5^2 * 3 * 2^2 = 360. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 6, since 6 is the smallest positive integer whose square is divisible by 360.\n\nNow, we can write k = 6n for some positive integer n. Then, k^3 = (6n)^3 = 216n^3. Since 216 is divisible by 4000, we can write k^3 = 4000m + r for some integers m and r with 0 <= r < 4000. Taking the units digit of both sides, we get:\n\nr = k^3 mod 10 = (216n^3 mod 10) = (6n^3 mod 10)\n\nSince n is a multiple of 6, we have n^3 = 6p for some integer p. Therefore, r = (6p)^3 mod 10 = 216p^3 mod 10 = 6p^3 mod 10. \n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of 6p^3 for some integer p. We can do this by finding the units digit of p^3 and then multiplying it by 6. The units digit of p^3 depends on the units digit of p. If p has a units digit of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, then p^3 has a units digit of 0, 1, 8, 7, 4, or 5, respectively. If p has a units digit of 6, then p^3 has a units digit of 6. If p has a units digit of 7, then p^3 has a units digit of 3. If p has a units digit of 8, then p^3 has a units digit of 2. If p has a units digit of 9, then p^3 has a units digit of 9.\n\nTherefore, the possible units digits of p^3 are 0, 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, and 9. Multiplying each of these by 6, we get the possible units digits of 6p^3 as 0, 6, 48, 42, 24, 30, 36, 18, 12, and 18. \n\nSince k is a multiple of 6, we know that n is a multiple of 6 as well. Therefore, the possible units digits of k^3 are 0, 6, 48, 42, 24, 30, 36, 18, 12, and 18. However, we also know that k^3 is divisible by 4000, which means that its units digit must be 0.

We want to find the smallest possible value of x + y, subject to this equation.\n\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n80x + 70y = 4z\n\nNow we can see that y must be even, since 70 is even and 4z is even.
