Let's assume that it takes Allen and Bob t hours to meet for the second time. Then, Allen's distance covered will be 54t km and Bob's distance covered will be 78t km. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can write the equation: 78t - 54t = 48. Solving for t, we get t = 2 hours. Now, we can find the distance between X and Y using the formula: distance = speed * time. Allen's distance covered will be 54 * 2 = 108 km and Bob's distance covered will be 78 * 2 = 156 km. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 156 - 108 = 48 km. The choice is therefore (E).", "prediction": "(E)."}

We know that the area of the field is 680 square feet, so we can write:\n\nl x w = 680\n\nWe also know that the field is to be fenced on three sides, leaving a side of 20 feet uncovered. This means that the length and width of the field must be greater than 20 feet. Let's assume that the length of the field is \"L\" and the width of the field is \"W\". Then we can write:\n\nL > 20\nW > 20\n\nWe can use these inequalities to solve for the length and width of the field. Let's start by solving for the length:\n\nL x W = 680\nL > 20\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by W to get:\n\nL = 680 / W\n\nSince L > 20, we know that W must be greater than 34.
