# Online Shopping

We use WebShop project for this part. Please refer to
[WebShop](https://webshop-pnlp.github.io/) and its [repo](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/WebShop).

## Modification

Based on the original repo, we added LLM agents and modified the `run_envs/run_web_agent_text_env.py` to run the tests.
Specifically, we used `text` mode to demonstrate the environment to the agent.
