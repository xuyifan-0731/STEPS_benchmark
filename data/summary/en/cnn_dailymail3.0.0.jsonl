{"question": "Ben Mee is more concerned with the impact Burnley\u2019s win could have on their bid for Premier League survival than the blow it has dealt to his old club Manchester City.

{"question": "An Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death testified Wednesday that she would 'rather die' than hurt the little girl, and denied making her run as punishment. Joyce Hardin Garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. When defense attorney Richard Rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt Savannah or any other grandchildren, Garrard replied, 'I'd rather die first.' The 49-year-old Garrard said she and Savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking, taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play. She said she was telling Savannah the importance of not lying. Took the stand: Joyce Garrard, 49, took the stand in her own defense Wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10-year-old granddaughter Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy . 'I was picking up sticks with her because I felt just as responsible for her lying as she was,' Garrard testified. Prosecutors say Garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy. 'It was 'more like a jog and not a run,' Garrard maintained. Garrard said Savannah was such an active child, the only way to hold her attention was to keep her moving. 'We was hooting and hollering, fussing back and forth,' Garrard said. Garrard said they picked up sticks for about 40 minutes, but spent much of the day in the yard. She said Savannah told her she had to go to the bathroom and they were racing into the house when the girl fell backward. Garrard said that's when she told Savannah's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, to call 911. 'Did you have some intent to hurt Savannah?' Rhea asked. 'Not that day or any other day,' Garrard replied. Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), 9, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right) One word on a 911 recording could help decide Garrard's fate. With 9-year-old Savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone, Joyce Hardin Garrard asked for something \u2014 either a cigarette or a blanket. The request, depending on exactly what she said, could be considered callousness or compassion. On the Feb. 17, 2012, recording, played in court Tuesday, Garrard is heard in the background as the girl's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, talked for more than 11 minutes with Lori Beth Beggs, a 911 operator in Etowah County. 'My daughter had a seizure,' Hardin says at the beginning. Speaking in a loud voice as Hardin talks to Beggs, Garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child's name and asking her to wake up. 'Savannah. Savannah,' Garrard says in a steady voice. 'Savannah, open your eyes.' Then, nearly three minutes into the recording, with Savannah still unresponsive, Garrard makes a request. 'Give me a smoke,' Beggs testified the woman said. The defense maintains she said: 'Give me a throw,' referring to a small blanket. While jurors have listened to the recording, Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree refused to let them see a transcript of the audio prepared for the defense. What the jurors believe she said could be vital. If Garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying, jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours. If they believe the woman said 'throw,' jurors could see that as sign Garrard was worried and trying to help the girl. Other testimony showed that the girl was wrapped in a small blanket when firefighters and paramedics arrived. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death wasn't Gerrard's fault . Prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine Garrard later Wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney. Garrard faces a death sentence or life without parole if convicted of capital murder. The girl's stepmother is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped. A defense expert said in dramatic testimony Tuesday that he wouldn't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death, yet he agreed the child wouldn't have died without exhausting physical exertion. Questioned by an attorney for Garrard at her capital murder trial, forensic pathologist Dr. James Lauridson indicated he couldn't say someone else caused the death of Savannah Hardin, 9. 'Knowing what I know I would not have called this a homicide, I would have called it indeterminate,' said Lauridson, retired chief medical examiner for Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Lauridson \u2014 using water, dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency \u2014 said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started seizing. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Jurors paid close attention to Lauridson, standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony. Garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter's death wasn't a homicide. But under cross-examination by prosecutor Marcus Reid, Lauridson admitted he didn't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to Dr. Emily Ward, the state pathologist who ruled that the girl's death was a homicide. Her decision was crucial to the decision to charge Garrard. Neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old Boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop, and Reid drove home the point to jurors. 'It was running that killed her. Isn't that right?' Reid asked Lauridson. 'Yes,' Lauridson replied. Lauridson's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator Chris Crow, who helped Ward with the post-mortem investigation of Savannah's death. Crow testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy. The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said. Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as 'pretty quick' for such an examination. But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed, and Ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garrard, who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012. Garrard, of Boaz, says she is innocent. Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state. Defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death .", "answer": ["Joyce Garrard, 49, is charged with killing 10-year-old Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy .\nGarrard took the witness stand Wednesday to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin .\nGarrard's lawyers haven't denied that the girl ran before her collapse, but the defense said the woman had no intention of harming her granddaughter ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "New Zealand reached their first ever World Cup final as they secured a sensational four-wicket Duckworth/Lewis win over South Africa at a sold out Eden Park on Tuesday. An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory.

The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand\u2019s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of \u2018chokers\u2019 and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand\u2019s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps\u2019 fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla\u2019s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side\u2019s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw\u2019s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier\u2019s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier\u2019s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa\u2019s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34.

Duminy (left) celebrates with Du Plessis as South Africa appeared to take control of the contest . Taylor was caught behind for 30, as New Zealand struggled to keep up with the rate . It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel\u2019s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland .

{"question": "(CNN)Newly released al Qaeda documents, including letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year or so before his May 2011 death, show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the CIA drone program that was killing many of the group's leaders in Pakistan's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. As a result of this pressure, al Qaeda officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as Afghanistan or Iran. They also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Pakistani government had any clue about bin Laden's location or presence in Pakistan. CIA efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in June 2010 an al Qaeda official urged bin Laden, \"You should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period. Make the period between contacts longer and further apart. Take excessive caution and care, especially this year.\" This was wise counsel. Within a few weeks of this letter being written, the CIA would track bin Laden's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 1, 2011, a U.S. Navy SEAL operation ordered by President Barack Obama killed al Qaeda's leader. The new al Qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the SEALs recovered at bin Laden's compound. Several were released during the Brooklyn trial last month of al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer. Seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of bin Laden's death. It's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world, just as ISIS does today. The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden. The documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al Qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against Western targets. In a report on \"external operations,\" an al Qaeda official explained that a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Russia had fizzled and that despite sending al Qaeda members to the UK to hit \"several targets\" these operations had also come to nothing. Al Qaeda had also sent \"three brothers\" on a terrorist mission to Denmark, a country that bin Laden loathed because of the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but had \"lost contact with them.\" Given all the problems the group was having, an al Qaeda strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the \"simplest things such as \u2028household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as \u2028killing tools.\" 2011: U.S. offers details about bin Laden raid . A major theme of the documents is how much punishment the CIA drone program was inflicting on al Qaeda. Al Qaeda officials considered moving to Nuristan, a remote mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, or to other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh or Balochistan and even to Iran, which had been a key sanctuary for a number of al Qaeda's leaders after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. Al Qaeda mulled opening an office in Iran, but \"we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations.\" In a letter to bin Laden, an al Qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of Mustafa Yazid, then the No. 3 leader of the group, on the night of May 22, 2010. The al Qaeda official wrote that Yazid was staying at the house of a \"well-known\" supporter of al Qaeda when a drone started making \"distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced. They all know that if a plane starts doing these turns, it is going to strike.\" Yazid and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike, according to the official. The official lamented that drones are \"still circling our skies every day\" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover. The official wrote but \"then they come back when the sky is clear.\" Al Qaeda had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones \"but no result so far,\" according to the al Qaeda official. Underlining al Qaeda's weakness, during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the Pakistani government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al Qaeda's battle was \"primarily against the Americans. You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone.\" Highlights of bin Laden documents released in 2012 . The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis. At one point an al Qaeda official referred to \"bin Laden's call to jihad against the apostate government of Pakistan.\" Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda. According to the documents, Pakistani intelligence officials \"reached out to\" al Qaeda through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the Haqqani Taliban faction that have contacts with the ISI. The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive. Bergen in 2013: Bin Laden's life on the run . Moreover during the course of reporting the book \"Manhunt,\" about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad. The documents did show one area of real success for al Qaeda, which was kidnapping for ransom, a tactic ISIS has been using so effectively. In 2008, al Qaeda had captured Afghanistan's former ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Khaliq Farahi. After two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $5 million. An al Qaeda official told bin Laden that some of this money would be a \"gift\" to him \"from all the brothers.\" Bin Laden cautioned al Qaeda's leaders to be careful with the ransom money, as it might have to last the terrorist group several years. The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations. 2011: How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . Far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed, the documents portray bin Laden as a hands-on manager of al Qaeda. In a 10-page letter that bin Laden wrote in August 2010, he had reams of advice for the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, ordering that the group not attack Sufi Muslims in Somalia and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the President of neighboring Uganda who had sent his troops to fight Al-Shabaab. Bin Laden gave detailed notes about how Al-Shabaab could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation, and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from Indonesia. He also advised Al-Shabaab against cutting down too many trees because it is \"dangerous for the environment of the region.\" Bin Laden had lived in nearby Sudan in the mid-'90s, establishing a number of business and farming enterprises. Bin Laden, something of a micromanager, told his top lieutenant to \"send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions.\" He also cautioned against sending any emails, including even encrypted ones, urging that hand-delivered letters were the only safe method of communication. Bergen on 2012 documents: Seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager . Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand \"the enemy's policies in the region.\" And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past, so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Bin Laden said he didn't want Zaidan to interview any members of his family, but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter \"promptly\" to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer. Bin Laden was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As the new al Qaeda documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the West was just that: a dream. And the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the CIA drone program.

Since the February 15 ceasefire, fighting may have eased but it has  not stopped\u00a0altogether. The thump of artillery fire and the rattle of automatic guns still echo through a bleak landscape of fallen trees and splintered houses. Going home is still not a safe option. Life in the basement is simple, but with working electricity, the family have light and are able to use stoves to cook. A shabby collection of furniture and materials salvaged from buildings above decorates their underground home. Much of the natural light that the few windows allow in is blocked by protective sandbags. The desperate family are just a few of the thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - which began in April 2014 after Kiev sent its military to the southeastern regions that refused to recognize the new authorities in the capital.

{"question": "(CNN)She married a man whose first wife mysteriously disappeared. And she stood by him even after he admitted killing a neighbor and chopping up the body. But who is Debrah Lee Charatan, the wife of millionaire heir Robert Durst? And what role has she played in his life? Charatan hasn't spoken publicly since her husband's arrest in New Orleans over the weekend, and CNN was unable to reach her for comment. In \"The Jinx,\" the HBO documentary about Durst's life, she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago. The series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between Durst and Charatan. Charatan says she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing. The two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before Durst's longtime friend Susan Berman turned up dead in Beverly Hills, California. This week, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged Durst with first-degree murder in that case. It's an accusation he has long denied. He also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife's disappearance. In a 2003 trial, he admitted he'd shot a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, and dismembered the body, but was acquitted of murder after arguing he'd acted in self defense. Recorded jailhouse calls from Durst's imprisonment during that case suggest that Charatan was his rock. \"Am I supposed to be smiling or am I supposed to be grim?\" Durst asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial. Charatan quickly replies, \"I would just have as close to no expression, yeah, that's what I think.\" She was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney Michael Kennedy, a lawyer Durst's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case. The insanity defense Kennedy was planning to use, she said at the time, could have meant both Durst and Charatan were cut out of the family fortune. \"What he doesn't want is me to get any of the trust money later on, since I'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time, OK, that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions,\" she says in another call. Like Durst himself, Charatan is a powerful player on the New York real estate scene. \"She's not some opportunistic woman who came into Bob's life for monetary gain. She was very successful, a millionaire several times over long before she met Bob,\" said Amir Korangy, publisher of TheRealDeal.com. Susan Criss, the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial, said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it's clear that Charatan is motivated by financial gain. \"It's very clear that she only cares about the money,\" Criss said. Some former friends and employees described Charatan in less than glowing terms. Former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions. According to sources, she only briefly lived with Durst and they are now separated, though still married. Why doesn't the HBO documentary feature any more recent interviews with her? Charatan didn't want Durst to participate in \"The Jinx,\" Korangy said, and she hasn't spoken with him since it started airing. CNN's Catherine E.

Patrick Kennedy told The Associated Press after visiting Jackson behind bars. Kennedy said he spoke with Jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 \u00bd-year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items. The expenditures included fur capes, lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before Election Day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of federal crimes in a scheme that involved spending mroe than $750,000 of his campaign money on more than 3,000 personal items . BIG HOUSE: Jackson sered his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina \u2013 the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 and were present for their son's sentencing . Jackson began the sentence on Nov. 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as Sept. 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods \u2013 including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, \"I'm leaving Thursday morning\",' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy.

Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.", "answer": ["Former congressman pleaded guilty in 2013 to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife \u2013 buying more than 3,000 items .\nSentenced to 30 months but will move to a halfway house tomorrow after serving barely half of that behind bars .\nAnother former Democratic congressman visited him in prison and learned about the impending move .\nJackson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before his downward spiral .\nHis father is the civil rights activist and preacher Rev.

{"question": "The former ACT chief minister has revealed a long-term, exhausting battle with anorexia, which saw her weight dwindle to a mere 30 kilograms. The 59-year-old has announced her teenage struggles at a function on Monday and has shared that she still has to have little discussions with herself about body image and naturally thinks she is too fat. Now the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Carnell has recalled beginning to lose weight at 12 or 13 years old when a teenage interest in boys and fashion sparked. The head of the Australia Chamber of Commerce announced her continuing struggles at a function on Monday . She said she felt rotten about herself and what she was doing to others in her life. 'I was stick thin but people said 'wow you are looking so great.' I wasn't - I was looking really skinny,' she told ABC television. 'It is hard to understand why you can't put a piece of food in your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. How hard can that be. When you've got anorexia it's like moving a mountain,' she said. The ABC reported that Ms Carnell was in and out of hospitals in her home town of Brisbane during the 1960s and 70s and was lying to her parents about what she was eating and the amount of exercise she was doing. The battle with anorexia began when she was 12 or 13 and she gained an interest in boys and fashion . Her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms and saw her in and out of hospitals . When 15-years-old, she was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney when the situation became severe. 'For a 15-year-old away from home it was to say the least pretty scary,' she said. She said her parents were only allowed to visit occasionally and she was incredibly homesick. 'Imagine a scenario when you've got a teenage daughter who's always been a bit of an overachiever, pretty smart \u2014 and all of a sudden they're killing themselves in front of your eyes,' she said. Ms. Carnell outlined these experiences at a function where the advocacy group The Butterfly Foundation released a report that outlined the high cost of treating eating disorders that affected almost a million Australians. The chairman of the Butterfly Foundation, David Murray said their report from Deloitte focuses on the economic cost of the problem and the large benefits of intervention. 'Early intervention pays big time, with about a 50 per cent cost reduction for the government in the health system by getting the problem early enough,' he said. 'We have to adjust the system for early intervention which very quickly recognises this as a mental condition and brings in the right type of specialist support.'", "answer": ["The head of the ACCI outlined her struggles at a function on Monday .\nThrough her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms .\nAt 15 years old she was sent to a psychiatric facility in Sydney .\nChairman of The Butterfly Foundation has said intervention pays big time ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Some of us are not obvious cruisers. I have an irrational fear of death by drowning and can't bear the thought of eating three meals a day, every day. So the prospect of a 16-day voyage round New Zealand to Australia is alarming. Will I survive? Or will I disappear overboard, laden with food, the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster? New Zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains, fjords, forests, glaciers, and lakes, home to the dolphin, whale, penguin, albatross, seal and sea-lion (there is a difference: the latter eat the former for breakfast). A place to pause: The tiny port of Picton is a gateway to the winelands of New Zealand's Marborough region . Home, too, to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson-flowered pohutukawa, the New Zealand Christmas tree. And you can get oysters everywhere. It's a long journey to New Zealand, so make sure you find somewhere to recover. The Boatshed on Waiheke Island, a short ferry ride from Auckland, is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land. I'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a Harley Davidson - 1800cc of shiny, macho metal. 'Have you ridden an HD before?' asks my hunky 'chauffeur'. No, but I used to have a Lambretta 125. Coming back for more: A high percentage of people on the Seabourn Odyssey are returning passengers . 'Just lean when I lean,' he says. I cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed. My cruising worries begin to evaporate when I meet the crew of Seabourn Odyssey. 'Welcome home,' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words, until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees. In our ship-shape suite, everything is sparklingly clean (as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps, I notice these things). Captain Cook charted the coastline of New Zealand 245 years ago. As well as unpredictable seas, he feared scurvy, caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which leads to suppurating wounds, loss of teeth and ultimately death. No danger of that on the Odyssey. I can't think of another period in my life when I've eaten so well, so consistently. Cook pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut; I sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canap\u00e9. That night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep. Taken for a ride: Sue took a tour of Waiheke island in speedy two-wheeled style - on a Harley Davidson . The ship has 450 passengers, 11 decks, four restaurants, a spa, fitness centre, swimming pool, hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than Cook's ship. On day one, we disembark andhead for Rotorua and its strange geothermal pools. 'Tours4Matures' says a minibus sign \u2014 a reminder of the age profile. We hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud, hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters. But why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap can't reach? We get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing. Independence comes at a price. Crossing the Cook Strait to South Island, we anchor at the tiny port of Picton and take an excursion into the Marlborough High Country, to a remote sheep station where we meet Hailey Pitts. She and her husband Jeremy farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep. It's a hard life, but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it. As we cruise through Queen Charlotte Sound, said to be Captain Cook's favourite anchorage, peace envelops me. I sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us. What a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station. Idyllic: Waiheke island sits on Auckland's doorstep - but feels far removed from New Zealand's biggest city . Ah, well - what's for dinner? In Akaroa, we see Hector's dolphin, the smallest and rarest in the world. In Port Chalmers, we climb up to a memorial to Captain Robert Scott. He set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the South Pole. The sunset is spectacular that night and I think of Captain Scott and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears, leaving behind a trail of light, first pink, then orange, then burgundy, until finally blackness falls. (Trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite. Let's just say it was moving.) On south, until we hit the last land before the South Pole, the beautiful Stewart Island. Due west - nothing but sea until the tip of South America. Due east - ditto. It's time to turn and head out to Australia. It's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of New Zealand across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne. Gale force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves. My irrational fears return. The crossing takes three long days and nights, But I come to realise how a big ship like the Odyssey can cope with such seas. I relax into the camaraderie that develops on board, and at long last we're cruising into Melbourne and then along the coast to Sydney. Calm comforts: Picton is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the Cook Strait . At 6am on a beautiful summer's morning, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge welcome us to a city full of promise. That afternoon, I watch from my hotel window as the Seabourn Odyssey sets sail once more, back to Auckland. Now someone else is in suite 722.

{"question": "(CNN)Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. \"In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. \"While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\"", "answer": ["A new study shows a 43% lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco-vegetarian diet .\nColorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the U.S.\nPlant-based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure ."], "label": "SUM"}

A flare, hurled from the stands, sails towards the Russian keeper  in the opening seconds of the game . Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, which led to a 30 minute delay before game was called off . The match in Podgorica was abandoned after 67 minutes with the score still at 0-0 after Russia's Dmitri Kombarov was hit by an object, which led to a melee between the players. The game had already been suspended once, in the first minute when the Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was struck on the head by a flare and was taken to hospital for treatment for burns. Play resumed after a 33-minute delay and the start of the second half was also delayed by 18 minutes due to further disturbances. The eventual abandonment came shortly after Russia's Roman Shirokov had a penalty saved by Vukasin Poleksic. The keeper looks in serious distress as he is carried off the field on the way to hospital for tests . CSKA Moscow have confirmed that Akinfeev should return to face Zenit St Petersburg this weekend .

{"question": "Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his\u00a0taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  \u00a3450-a-night hotels during his \u00a313,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the\u00a0Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one \u00a3896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for \u00a3450-a-night hotels during his \u00a313,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that\u00a0Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around \u00a31,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around \u00a310,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least \u00a36,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put \u00a3743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to \u00a3120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of \u00a3383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that \u00a3383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' \u00a3272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and \u00a3208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the \u00a3150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by \u00a3203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just \u00a361.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged \u00a3896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some \u00a34,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The \u00a3896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one \u00a3896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the \u00a3150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by \u00a3203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly \u00a35,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined \u00a31,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

{"question": "Chile's president went to a hospital Saturday to meet with a 14-year-old girl who shocked the country by going on YouTube to plead for the leader to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis. The government quickly said no after the video began spreading on social media Thursday. A government statement said President Michelle Bachelet talked with Valentina Maureira and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in the capital. Scroll down for video . President Michelle Bachelet, right, poses for a selfie with Valentina Maureira, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, at a hospital in Santiago, Chile . Officials did not release any information on what was said. But the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Valentina taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Maureira, a 14-year girl who suffers cystic fibrosis and asked the Government for permission to die through a YouTube video, at the Clinic Hospital of Catholic University of Santiago de Chile . Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia. 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said. Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said. Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old . Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.' 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life. 'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said.

{"question": "Host commentator . That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid \u00a390million for Bale or \u00a365m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it. Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters. They definitely won\u2019t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad. Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata. I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game \u2013 that is something that is always missing from a Clasico. Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I\u2019ve seen him recently. Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball. He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn\u2019t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night. He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo\u2019s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn\u2019t see a great deal of the ball. He certainly didn\u2019t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself. Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he\u2019d played some part in \u2013 no Barcelona player has played in more. What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Bar\u00e7a vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He\u2019ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it. Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying. So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don\u2019t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you\u2019ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome. Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest. He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch. You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very happy for several reasons. Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club\u2019s supporters \u2013 he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called \u2018fans\u2019 have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning). He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year. CLICK HERE to read the full story as angry Madrid fan attacks Bale's car . Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid. Paul Clement would I\u2019m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal \u2013 who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League \u2013 would have a coach who has won the competition three times. It all sounds perfect, I don\u2019t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion! Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn\u2019t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca. We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Liverpool don\u2019t exactly play like Harry Basset\u2019s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him. It\u2019s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him. Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season. The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader\u2019s performance. Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard. It\u2019s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn\u2019t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning \u2018La Decima\u2019 but he hasn\u2019t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change. Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge. Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward. Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3. He put a decent shift in but if he\u2019s working back he can\u2019t also be on Jordi Alba\u2019s shoulder waiting to pull away. This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities. He also faded last night because the team did \u2013 Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered. Pete Jenson: It\u2019s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives. But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too. So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game. Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool. In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal. At Barcelona he\u2019s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season \u2013 but he will score more important ones.

{"question": "(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice.

{"question": "Luis Enrique says England's lack of a winter break may have given Barcelona an advantage against Manchester City \u2013 and he hopes the Premier League don't change their fixture list. Manuel Pellegrini suggested after City's 1-0 defeat in the Nou Camp that the number of games English clubs played in December and January meant they struggled in the latter stages of the Champions League. City's 3-1 aggregate defeat followed Arsenal's exit at the hands of Monaco on Tuesday and Chelsea's defeat by Paris Saint-Germain last week \u2013 leaving no English clubs in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons. Luis Enrique conceded Barcelona may have an advantage over English sides due to the winter break . Ivan Rakitic (right) scored as Barcelona beat Manchester City 1-0 in the Nou Camp on Wednesday . City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes the games his team play over Christmas hinder them in Europe . And Enrique has some sympathy for Pellegrini. 'We are used to resting during winter with our families,' Enrique said. 'I heard (Southampton manager) Ronald Koeman complaining about the number of fixtures in England, so maybe it is an advantage for us. 'I don't know, it is impossible to say, but we do enjoy watching the English teams playing on Boxing Day.' Speaking after the game, Pellegrini suggested the heavy fixture scheduling played a part in City's demise. Lionel Messi's Barcelona eliminated City by beating them 3-1 on aggregate in the Champions League . For the second time in three years, there are not any English teams in the last eight of the Champions League .

{"question": "Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at\u00a0Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators \u00a33,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'", "answer": ["Teacher Kim Davies made more than 20 complaints against a colleague .\nShe lodged a further nine complaints with an exam board .\nMs Davies faced a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct .\nThe teacher was followed by private detectives after taking sick leave .\nCaerphilly Council thought Ms Davies was trying to defraud the system .\nMs Davies was reprimanded by a watchdog for breaking a number of rules .\nShe was also criticised for making several vexatious complaints .\nMs Davies avoided a classroom ban following the watchdog's hearing .\nShe said she now wanted to get back into the classroom and teach ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station completed a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet, NASA reported. In a tweet, the space agency said astronaut Terry Virts experienced water inside his helmet, just as he did Wednesday, but \"it's a known issue; no concern.\" The spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes, NASA said. \"Crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks,\" the agency said in a release. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of \"sublimator water carryover.\" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had \"a high degree of confidence\" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water, and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it. She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as \"wet and cold.\" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.  NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space.", "answer": ["Spacewalk last more than five hours; crews have spent more than 1,171 hours spacewalking .\nAstronaut Terry Virts found a small amount of water inside his helmet ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A London woman is embroiled in a fight for compensation with Jet Airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight-hour flight. Passengers, including two families with infant children, were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London. Traveller Amrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows, and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor. Photos show water trickling into the aisle (left) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess (right) The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: \u2018After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats. \u2018We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating. \u2018He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.\u2019 She added: \u2018It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as \u2026 the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.\u2019 Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks. Passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin . In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener. Amrita said: \u2018This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack. \u2018After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.\u2019 Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well. Passengers were forced to endure the stench for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London . She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology. She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways\u2019 frequent flyer club. She wasn\u2019t satisfied with the offer, saying: \u2018Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience. A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Jet Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to guests on board flight 9W122 DEL - LHR dt.,Feb 15, 2015, on account of reverse drainage from the sinks on board the aircraft. 'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.' Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks . Ms Jaurre said: \u2018Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin. \u2018I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.\u2019 She added: \u2018I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.\u2019 She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket. \u2018Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.\u2019", "answer": ["Passengers, including infant children, endured the pungent smell for hours .\nAmrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows .\nCabin crew tried to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor .\nPassengers used articles of clothing to try to mask the foul odour .\nMs Jaurre, 27, said she suffered a headache and became nauseous ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A striking set of twins, who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed-race parentage, have revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, both 18, said classmates at school thought they were telling fibs when they revealed they were twins. Lucy and Maria's mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin. Lucy (left) and Maria (right) Aylmer, both 18, have faced questions from curious strangers throughout their lives over their radically different looks. Lucy even uploaded a photo of her birth certificate to Facebook . The twins say it isn't just their looks that are different, they have individual personalities too. Lucy (far left) says she's much more shy than her sister Maria (second left), despite being born 23 seconds before her . Speaking to Ben Shepherd and Susanna Reid, the twins, from Gloucester, opened up about how their distinctively different looks had often made life difficult at school. Red-haired Lucy said her pale complexion had prompted speculation that she'd been adopted:\u00a0'My classmates used to ask if I was adopted because my siblings are all quite dark. 'It was pretty hard, it went on in secondary school and it wasn't very nice.' When the girls were first born in 1997, their mother Donna had no idea that she could give birth to such different looking twins, described by experts as a one-in-a-million chance. Growing up, the girls said they regularly overheard people asking their mum 'Which one is yours?' or 'Are you the childminder?'. Although most of their friends now know their unique story, they still have to present new acquaintances with photos of their birth certificates to prove they really are twin sisters. 'Our friends do believe us now because we make a big fuss,' says Maria. 'We've got birth certificates. Lucy even had a picture of hers on her Facebook [profile].' As the girls have turned into grown-ups they've tried to find their own style. Lucy, who has naturally curly hair, straightens it to ensure a sleek look. And the twins stopped wearing the same outfits when they were seven. Lucy says: 'I think I said to my mum: \"I don't want to wear the same clothes as Maria any more\".' Same same, but different: \u00a0Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . When asked at what age the girls knew their situation might raise questions from others, they say it took them a long time to know that their family was anything but ordinary. 'It is what it is,' says Maria. 'We never even picked up on it until friends started talking about it at school.' Their mother, who is 47 and a warehouse worker, and their 53-year-old father, who works as a scaffolder, split up after the twins were born. The 18-year-olds have three older siblings, George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21. Lucy told the Daily Mail: \u2018Our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween Maria and I. We are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween. \u2018But my grandmother has a very fair English rose complexion, just like mine.\u2019 She added: \u2018No one ever believes we are twins. Even when we dress alike, we still don\u2019t look like sisters, let alone twins.\u2019 Family line: The twins' mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and their siblings George, Chynna and Jordan all have darker skin than Lucy and lighter than Maria . Two of a kind: The twins, who live in Gloucester,\u00a0were born in January 1997 . Different strokes: \u00a0'Outgoing' Maria studies law at Cheltenham College, while 'shy'\u00a0Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College . All together: Maria and Lucy with their mother Donna and siblings George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21 . Non-identical twins come from separate eggs, so inherit different genes. The girls\u2019 half-Jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin. By chance, Lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and Maria will have genes that code for black skin. People with Afro-Caribbean heritage often have some European DNA, dating back in many cases to the slave trade. This increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin. Lucy said of her time at school: \u2018We were in the same class, but no one had a problem telling us apart. Twins are known for swapping identities. But there was no way Maria and I could ever do anything like that. \u2018Most twins look like two peas in a pod \u2013 but we couldn\u2019t look more different if we tried. We don\u2019t look like we have the same parents, let alone having been born at the same time.\u2019 The twins\u2019 interests are as different as their looks. Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College whilst Maria studies law at Cheltenham College. Lucy explained: \u2018Maria was outgoing whilst I was the shy one. But Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin \u2013 and I\u2019m very proud of having a black twin.\u2019", "answer": ["Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins .\nGrowing up,  mother Donna would be asked if she was their 'childminder'\nDonna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white .\nTwins say they have radically different styles ."], "label": "SUM"}

But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video .

But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity. 'We're not a snotty London art gallery, yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded 'Gingerbread House'.

Former England captain Lewis Moody does not think England are in a position to win the World Cup . Moody knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in 2003 . 'If they can get through the pool stages they'll have a great, fighting chance.

'They can certainly be there to push the others, and if they get into the semi-final then there is every chance they could make the final.'

They can still win it, but it will be a big ask now - we are reliant on other teams.' Moody added: 'I am a huge fan of Stuart Lancaster. 'I think he's done terribly well and I think all that now Stuart is lacking is that win, that result that really says, 'Look, what I've been doing over the last four years has been about this, achieving this', and if we can take something out of the Six Nations, which will be tough now, then he'll have that.'

I think (Luther) Burrell has been all right but I think Joseph and Tuilagi are probably the future.'

{"question": "The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday . Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system . Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench . Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder \u2013 was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool\u2019s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea\u2019s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool\u2019s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville\u2019s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson\u2019s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection . But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea\u2019s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side\u2019s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does.

Martin Skrtel (left) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved Liverpool defence . Yes, the defenders look more assured. Yes, Skrtel is proving himself a leader in the Liverpool defence. Against Swansea he was outstanding, even producing the initial pass that led to Henderson\u2019s goal. And yes, Sakho and Can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of Liverpool defenders. But they are working as a team, and playing with more composure after Rodgers realised the more cavalier approach they employed when Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were terrorising defenders just wasn\u2019t working this season. The statistics make interesting reading. Only five Premier League goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year. But it\u2019s as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of Rodgers. And while the deployment of Gerrard as a holding midfielder, and with it a slight change to a diamond formation, gave Henderson the freedom to get further forward last night, it was the mere fact that Henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of Sturridge\u2019s flick-on that earned Liverpool their goal.

{"question": "The off-duty New Jersey police officer who was behind the wheel during a wrong-way crash that killed two on Staten Island last week had eight previous accidents and a DUI on his record. Linden Officer Pedro Abad Jr. killed Officer Frank Viggiano and friend Joe Rodriguez - both 28 - when he drove the wrong way after a night at a  strip club and collided head-on with a tractor-trailer. Abad\u00a0had his license suspended for seven months starting in October 2013 after an alcohol-related accident in Rahway, New Jersey, in February of that year. Scroll down for video . Pedro Abad Jr. (pictured both) had eight accidents and a DUI on his record before the Staten Island crash . Abad was driving four people including himself when he crashed into the truck on Staten Island on March 20 . Off-duty officer Frank Viggiano, 28 (left), was in the rear right seat and died in the crash. Patrik Kudlac, 23 (right), is now in a critical condition. He was also off duty at the time. His license was taken after a a judge found Abad refused to submit to a chemical test and was driving under the influence. Before that crash, Abad had been involved in six accidents dating back to 2005, the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0reported. He was reportedly involved in another accident, his eighth, four months after the Rahway incident. It is unclear if he was determined to be at fault in the accidents. The fatal crash on the West Shore Expressway on March 20 on State Island was his ninth accident. Abad's license was restored in March 2014, but he had to use an ignition lock until September 2014, according to New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission spokeswoman\u00a0Elyse Coffey. The 27-year-old cop, who was hired as a police officer in 2008, was on the force at the time of the suspension. Abad and 23-year-old Officer Patrik Kudlac were in critical but stable condition after the crash.

{"question": "Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken out against two new laws in Indiana and Arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on 'religious liberty'. Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' He said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Scroll down for video . Marching: Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to hold a rally against the new law, which forbids the government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs . As well as opposing the Indiana law, in a tweet he called for Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill, HB1228, which has passed through the senate and is waiting to be rubber-stamped by the Republican. HB1228 is also named the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and uses the same wording as the Indiana legislation. The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff also announced on Twitter that he would no longer send employees or customers to Indiana. Proud: Cook said that, being born a Baptist, he supported religion, but added:\u00a0'I was never taught that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate' (Cook pictured centre at gay pride parade in San Francisco) Making a statement: Cook previously expressed opposition to the new laws in Indiana and Arkansas on his Twitter page . Cook's op-ed came after thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.' Pence said there was a 'tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding' surrounding the legislation, forms of which are already enshrined in law in 20 other states. Pence told the Indy\u00a0Star\u00a0he will support legislation to 'clarify' the controversial law, and expects it to go before the\u00a0General Assembly this week. While he did not discuss the wording of the new bill, he has previously said the intention of the law is to block government intervention in matters of conscience, rather than allowing people to discriminate against others.", "answer": ["Tim Cook, 54, condemned religious freedom law in Indiana and Arkansas .\nApple CEO said bills 'rationalize injustice' by pretending to defend religion .\nThey will take U.S. back to days of 'Whites Only' signs in stores, he said .\nLaw forbids government from 'substantially burdening' religious beliefs ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson has denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, has provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse for two days . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. Ian Paterson said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to\u00a0resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues through Wednesday.

Palace face Queens Park Rangers in Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off at Selhurst Park and their manager Chris Ramsey is the only ethnic minority boss in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew wants clubs to work on encouraging ethnic minority coaches to reflect the huge variety of cultures that players in England come from, rather than employing the same \u201cboys club\u201d members.

{"question": "London (CNN)The handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip:  makeup, bras, underwear, boots, an epilator. But this list was apparently made by the three UK schoolgirls suspected of traveling from London to Syria to join ISIS, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which has seen the document. The girls' families told British lawmakers Tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning, and said they were baffled by the teenagers' decision to leave their homes and families. The three East London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. They are thought to have crossed the Turkish border into Syria within days. Relatives also had harsh words for police, who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to Syria in December. Amira Abase's father, Hussen Abase, told lawmakers at a hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized. Sahima Begum, the older sister of Shamima Begum, said her sister had been into \"normal teenage things,\" like watching \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" reading and playing games on her phone. There was nothing to indicate she was radicalized, she said. Fahmida Aziz, first cousin of Kadiza Sultana, said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization, \"we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying\" that thinking. She also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said it was \"every parent's nightmare that this should happen\" and said he could only imagine the families' distress and anguish. Who are the missing UK girls? The families' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a February 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents, rather than being sent directly to the parents. The families claim they were not told about a 15-year-old friend of the girls going to Syria weeks earlier -- and say that had they known, they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too. Metropolitan Police Chief Bernard Hogan-Howe apologized for his officers' failure to get the letter directly to the parents, in his testimony before the committee. But he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left, with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit. Hogan-Howe said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told the committee there was a \"steady flow\" of girls trying to travel to Syria, perhaps one or two a month. He said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to Turkey at a local travel agency, using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families. None of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for Istanbul. However, the families' lawyer asked how they had managed, as minors, to board the flight without being challenged. CCTV footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of Istanbul -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether UK police had communicated effectively with Turkish authorities. Rowley said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing, who has not been named. Asked how the UK might be able to get the girls back, Rowley cited an incentive: As long as they're not connected to terrorist offenses, they'll be able to return to their families. Rowley said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism-related activities, and if that remained the case, they wouldn't be treated as terrorists upon their return. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? The list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing. It detailed items to buy, such as underwear, a mobile phone and cosmetics, and estimated travel costs, apparently totaling \u00a32,190 ($3,296). The biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to Turkey, the newspaper said, at just over \u00a31,000. The list, written on a page from a diary planner, had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for. It's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs. Over the weekend, the girls' families asked for an apology from London's Metropolitan Police over the force's handling of the case. The police said in a statement Saturday that after the first girl went missing in December, a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at Bethnal Green Academy -- including Shamima, Kadiza, and Amira -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl. A deputy principal at the girls' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls, on the advice of police, and told them that the girls' friend, referred to only as \"Girl 1,\" had been reported missing. An officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on February 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters, the police statement said. But not all the letters were passed on. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents,\" the police statement said. \"However, the parents were already aware from the Deputy Head that Girl 1 had been reported missing, all the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria.\" What is ISIS' appeal for young people? Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis, as she did. Her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter, which recommends that those traveling to Syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much, since they may need to move often and at short notice, while remaining inconspicuous.

{"question": "A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger . 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a \"girlfriend experience\" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' \u2013 which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it \u2013 has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability\u00a0as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles. They are hoping to prove that Lord Morrow's law contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, including the rights to privacy, health and protection from degrading treatment. The law may even flout the human right to life. If prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous, Laura has no doubt that deaths will follow. 'Sex workers are going to suffer,' she said. 'I witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when I was working in Dublin. As soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit, violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it wasn't too long before [21-year-old sex worker] Sinead Kelly was stabbed to death by a client.' Last year, a similar law was proposed in the UK by MP Fiona Mactaggart. But after a campaign by the English collective of Prostitutes (ECP), the Sex Worker Open University and the Women's Institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote. Laura Watson of the ECP said they are behind Laura Lee's fight in Northern Ireland. 'Internationally, sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger,' she said. 'Legal challenges, spearheaded by sex workers, are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection.'", "answer": ["Laura Lee, 37, travels between Scotland and Ireland as a sex worker .\nIt means that from June 1, men who pay for sex could be arrested .\nThe mother believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony believes the champions now have to target victory in every remaining game to retain their title. City remain five points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea after slipping to a 2-1 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday. The London side also have a game in hand and City have just 11 matches left to turn the situation around. Wilfried Bony says Manchester City can still retain the Premier League if they win all their remaining games . Bony has only made appearances from the bench so far for City, and was booked in the defeat by Liverpool . Bony said: 'It is disappointing, we have made it difficult for ourselves now. 'If Chelsea win (their game in hand) it will be more difficult for us to get close to them. But we still hope - there are 11 more games and every game we just have to win, be positive for the rest of the league and try to get maximum points. 'We need to win, win, win and hope Chelsea will drop some points. It is a difficult moment for us but we still hope we can do it.' Bony might hope to play a greater role in City's run-in after making just three goalless substitute appearances since signing from Swansea in January. City were beaten 2-1 at Anfield after stunning strikes from Jordan Henderson and Coutinho (above) Bony will hope to make more of an impact on the title run-in than he has been able to so far since signing . In between Henderson and Coutinho's strikes Edin Dzeko equalised, but City were well beaten . Bony did not feature for a month after the move was completed due to his involvement in Ivory Coast's African Nations Cup win and has had to make do with coming off the bench since. His 78th-minute introduction at Anfield came with his side already 2-1 down and he was unable to affect the outcome. His only notable contribution to the game came when he was booked for an aerial challenge on Adam Lallana that arguably could have been worth a red card. City had cancelled out Jordan Henderson's superb early strike with a well-worked Edin Dzeko equaliser but the outstanding Philippe Coutinho restored the hosts' lead with a 75th-minute stunner. Sergio Aguero had hit the post and he spurned two other good chances, while David Silva also went close late on, but Liverpool dominated and ultimately deserved their victory.

Pellegrini defended his selection after he stuck with the same line-up that thrashed Newcastle last week . Manager Manuel Pellegrini will continue to chase Chelsea but the challenge from below is strengthening, with third-placed Arsenal just four points behind. Pellegrini said: 'We are worried about our team, not the other teams that are behind us. It is important to try and continue playing the normal way.

{"question": "(CNN)Real Madrid's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front. Sunday's 6-1 demolition of Rayo Vallecano put the Catalan side one point above Real at the top of Spain's La Liga, with Lionel Messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward Luis Suarez also scored twice. Even without suspended Brazil star Neymar -- the third prong of Barca's striking line -- Enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in Madrid wounds following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao. \"We're elated, but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season. I already said that everybody could lose a game, so we have to keep playing well and win every match,\" he said. \"It's heavy having to win every single match. Each game is more important than the last.\" By contrast, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against Villarreal. \"There is no link-up play, our play is too based around individual play, we need another way of attacking, with faster play and fewer touches,\" said the Italian, who must rouse his troops for Tuesday's European Champions League last-16, second-leg tie at home to Schalke. \"It is quite confusing to see what we're doing at the moment in attack. The ball doesn't move around quickly.\" While Real's front trio of top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season, Barca's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams' \"El Clasico\" clash at the Nou Camp in a fortnight. Messi's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a Spanish club player, and took him past Ronaldo as the La Liga leader on 24 trebles. The Argentina star also drew level with the Portugal captain as the Spanish league's top scorer this season on 30 goals. It's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals, with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign. Suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games, and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from English club Liverpool after a World Cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. \"Suarez and Messi are having more and more chemistry, and today we all saw what they bring to the team,\" Enrique said. \"I like (Ivan) Rakitic wherever he plays on the field. He always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we've ever had.\" \"(Gerard) Piqu\u00e9 has always known how to score, above all on set plays. It's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively.\" Both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000, Barca's best this season: Rayo defender Tito for a foul on Suarez in the 55th minute that allowed Messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty; and Dani Alves for tripping Alberto Bueno, who also netted the resulting spot-kick. Barca's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid after the defending champion's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed Valencia later Sunday. Koke put Atletico ahead in the first half but Shkodran Mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left, while Valencia teammate Javi Fuego received two late yellow cards. Sixth-placed Villarreal beat Celta Vigo 4-0, while Real Sociedad beat Espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash. In Italy, second-placed Roma missed a chance to put pressure on leader Juventus after being held 0-0 at struggling Chievo Verona on Sunday. It left Rudi Garcia's team eight points adrift of Juve, which hosts Sassuolo on Monday. Third-placed Napoli also drew, blowing a two-goal lead against Inter Milan as Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi, with an 87th-minute penalty, canceled out second-half goals by Marek Hamsik and Gonzalo Higuain.

{"question": "Winston Churchill planned to tempt America into joining World War Two by offering the country a priceless copy of the Magna Carta. The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through. Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value. Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution. In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift .

{"question": "Sepp Blatter celebrated his 79th birthday on Tuesday as one of his rivals for the FIFA presidency obtained some high-level support for his bid to be the most powerful person in world football. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has secured statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family. Although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on May 29 there is a history, particularly in Arab countries, of the ruling family influencing football policy. FIFA Vice President Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is in the running to become the next president of FIFA . The Prince sits alongside UEFA President Michel Platini during a\u00a0CONMEBOL congress on March 4 . That could be important to Prince Ali who has struggled to win support in his own Asian football confederation (AFC) - only one AFC country, his home country Jordan, nominated him to stand. It is by no means certain however that the Bahrain FA will back Prince Ali despite the King offering his support. AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is also from Bahrain and has already given his backing to Blatter. Furthermore, the leading powerbroker in Olympic sport Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah from Kuwait is also supporting Blatter. Ali bin al-Hussein has received backing from high profile supporters, including the King of Bahrain (above), . Sheikh Ahmad wields significant influence, especially in Asia as head of the Olympic Council of Asia, and is himself standing for the FIFA executive committee at the end of April. Prince Ali is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing, and also to have taken heart from last week's congress of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, where no formal vote to back Blatter was taken. A report from Jordan's government new agency stated: 'His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalif of Bahrain, on Monday, received HRH Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein accompanied by Interior Minister Hussein Majali, and stressed Bahrain's support to Prince Ali's bid for FIFA presidency.'

Luis Figo (left) and\u00a0Michael van Praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race . Last week van Praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from Europe. He also claimed Figo's plans for funding national associations would 'bankrupt FIFA'.

{"question": "Sharron O'Neill always knew she had something. Even before she was diagnosed with cancer as a teenager, she knew her family had a stronger link to the deadly disease than others. When Ms O'Neill was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in her late 20s, a genetic condition that makes someone more likely to get cancer, she said it wasn't surprise. Sharron O'Neil and her mother, Jilian Carter, both have Lynch syndrome. It is a genetic condition that makes someone 85 per cent more likely to get cancer . 'Our family always knew there was something; we just didn't know it was a gene and a specific thing,' Ms O'Neill said. 'But, once I found out about Lynch syndrome and knew what it was, it all started to make sense.' Mrs O'Neill was diagnosed with bowel cancer when she was just 19. A week earlier, her grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer. Her mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 39. Her family history with cancer extends back much further, with Ms O'Neill saying she tracked it back more than 200 years. 'The farthest back I have been able to go is to a relative who came to Australia on a boat as an orphan in the early 1800s,' she said. 'It covers six generations that I know of.' Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to a number of cancers including bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer, among many others. People with the gene have an 85 per cent chance of developing cancer before the age of 70. Ms O'Neill's great-grandmother died of cancer. Just five years later, her grandmother's sister did too. She said the family was 'on notice' from that point. In the following years, four of the five remaining children, including Ms O'Neill's grandmother,  faced three of more Lynch syndrome cancers, averaging out to almost one person per decade. Family ties: Mrs O'Neil's grandmother in the arms of her great grandmother . Lynch Syndrome Australia spokeswoman Beth Fairbank said approximately 20,000 Australians have the genetic condition, but only five per cent of people were diagnosed. 'There's 95 per cent of people walking around with it and they have no idea,' Ms Fairbank said. 'A lot of families that have a history of cancer think it's just a bit of bad luck and there's nothing that can be done about it, but in some cases it isn't bad luck and there are things that can be done. 'If there is such a thing, it can be a good cancer story. There are a lot of things that you can do and it really makes people aware and alert against it. 'People who know about the condition get checked much more regularly, which greatly reduces the overall risk from cancer.' Ms O'Neill said the most important thing is for people to start asking some potentially tough questions. 'There are a lot of factors that go into it, but everyone should be asking questions and looking at their family history,' she said. 'If a lot of people in your family under 50 have or had cancer, head to your GP and ask.' Lynch syndrome not only makes someone more likely to get cancer, but it also means they will likely get the disease earlier in life. In addition to that, Ms O'Neill said she had seen each person in her family get cancer at an early age than their parent or relative of the previous generation. That trend was one of the driving factors in why her and her husband decided against having children of their own. 'There are a lot of factors that went into it - our geneticist actually said it shouldn't stop us from having kids,' she said. 'But, it was a personal decision. I had seen people in my family get cancer at younger and younger ages. 'I was diagnosed at 19. The thought of having a child who would battle with cancer while they were or a teenager or at school was too much.' March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day and Australians are being urged to become aware of their family's cancer history . Lynch syndrome Australia director\u00a0Eve Raets promoted the day at Rundle Mall in Adelaide over the weekend . March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day, and Mrs O'Neill said the day should be used to make sure people know about the condition.

It's from a few years ago. It shows Bian Liangjing standing proudly in front of a temple gate. \"This is the best one because he looks so handsome,\" she laughs as tears fall on to the album. Bian was on his way back from Singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist's license. His boss decided it was cheaper to fly through Malaysia. He boarded the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year when it disappeared barely an hour into its journey. No trace has ever been found despite an extensive search. But his mother is convinced he's coming back. \"If it is one year, if it is two years or three, I am looking forward to his return. I know he is still alive,\" she says. I first met family members of those who were on the airliner that night as they stood in shock at the arrivals hall of Beijing airport. I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying \"none of those on board survived.\" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. \"I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,\" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience. Families complain of harassment by local communist party officials, several have been detained by Chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media.

{"question": "Sam Warburton is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time in the RBS 6 Nations showdown against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday. Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton:\u00a0I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off \u2014 one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for\u00a0Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France \u2014 especially with the 100 per cent lineout \u2014 and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend\u2026 if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle \u2014 how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running\u2026 How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

'We were concerned about this issue right from the start, so it was the first issue we tested and measured in our initial pre-clinical and clinical studies,' the company wrote on their site. 'Thus far, pigmentary glaucoma has not proved to be a problem in our pre-clinical or clinical studies.'

{"question": "A Penn State professor who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette and ranting about Obama said she was expressing an act of 'civil\u00a0disobedience'. Dr Karen Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after a flight from Nicaragua landed at Miami International Airport on Saturday. Halnon said she used the moment to protest 'U.S. military global domination,' claiming the country has 'declared war on Venezuela' and was responsible for giving her hero Hugo Chavez cancer. Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience' when she was filmed smoking and ranting about the US after her plane landed in Miami . The sociology professor also said the US was after Venezuela's water and oil. 'I had to speak out now,' she told Philadelphia Magazine. 'The situation is dire and urgent.' 'Any sacrifice I make for my own self, if it saves lives \u2014 there have been far too many lives lost due to U.S. global military domination.' Halnon claims she was 'tortured' by the FBI and TSA after she was arrested in Miami for disorderly conduct. 'I was put in a room with two fans in the ceiling, it was freezing cold for hours and hours and hours,' she said. Halnon alleged she was not allowed to go to the bathroom and had to wet her pants.\u00a0She said she also defecated on the floor and was forced to pick it up while being 'laughed at'. A number of passengers around Halnon became angered after she lit up on the plane. The professor said the act was a 'symbol'. 'Every revolutionary I know smokes,' she said. 'It was identifying with the revolutionary cause. 'Beyond that, it is a symbol that the United States is a smoking gun.' Halnon also questioned how she got through security with the lighter, which she said was right on top of her book bag. Halnon is seen smoking onboard the flight, in a video uploaded to YouTube and posted on Reddit . When fellow passengers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior, Halnon blamed someone else for smoking and went on a  rant, saying the US had 'declared war on Venezuela' 'The action was necessary,' she said. 'They are going to kill many more people.' During her political rant aboard the flight Halnon, who said she teaches about US imperialism in Latin America, equated the country's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. According to an eyewitness, she also allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. Halnon shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said, laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that\u00a0the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. But she yelled louder, ranting that Venezuela 'previously owned the oil in Venezuela.' 'My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people would own the oil...not Exon Mobil.' After she was warned again by a flight attendant that she was going to be arrested, Halnon remarked 'I know already.' 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff. A flight attendant, right, warned Halnon that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down.

{"question": "The day before George Osborne delivers his budget to the nation the Lawn Tennis Association came up with its rough equivalent \u2013 the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in Great Britain. Chief Executive Michael Downey finally unveiled his vision for the governing body, and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it. Over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing, so that by 2018 around \u00a326 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the United Kingdom. While Andy Murrayis established as one of the world's best players, problems still exist at grass roots level . Other countries will look on enviously at such a huge sum although, given the current rankings of most GB juniors, many may well comfort themselves that their stocks of elite players will be superior for years to come. Downey reaffirmed the LTA's laudable, broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this. However, there was nothing especially original to stir the imagination or make an impact with the wider public, no 'Parks tennis revolution' or some such thing. Anyone wanting to see something more radical to improve the British game would be left disappointed. Not that Downey, the former head of Tennis Canada who was appointed 18months ago, pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long-term plans for the British game. LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game . 'Our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that,' he said at the start. What he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis, like most other ball sports, has with declining participation numbers. They all face a challenge from what he termed 'doorstep' sports, highly convenient and less technically demanding activities such as running, cycling, swimming and going to the gym, which can be done solo and whenever time permits. Despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from Wimbledon profits and that event's ever growing popularity, there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years. The particular problem is among the 16-44 age group with numbers steady above that. Curiously he omitted to mention, until asked, that tennis is now played to a greater or lesser extent in 20,000 schools among 2.6 million children, an impressive figure that would be envied by most other sports. Among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things, there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis. 'I think the old LTA would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools,' he said. The LTA receives millions annually from funds generated by the Wimbledon Championships . There were other sensible ideas. With tennis participation peaking in July, there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year. Clubs, volunteers and coaches will get more support (attempts at this are nothing new). In junior tennis there will, wisely, be more emphasis on team events and there will be a much-needed concentration on creating a less pressured environment at junior tournaments. The emphasis will be on creating inclusive fun and recreational competitions across the board. Downey asserted that he was looking at the 'meat and potatoes' issues, rather than eyecatching initiatives. He also pledged that the LTA would spend money 'like it's your own' (no reference here to his own \u00a3434,000 pay package). It is, clearly, expecting too much for any results to be instant, as with the efforts to improve the elite end of tennis. He was unrepentant about cuts to the performance side of the game and funding for lower ranked players, pointing out that the average entry age into the world's top 100 is 21 for men and 20 for women. Murray's victory at SW19 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation . 'If you are 27 years old and still playing Futures I don't think you are going to be a top 50 player. It's a ruthless business,' he said, reiterating the 'no compromise' message he wants to run through the elite end of the sport. While there has to be a degree of patience with his plans, they also illustrated the glacial pace of how things tend to be done at the governing body compared to what would happen in the more dynamic private sector. There are many things that have not even been considered or barely thought about. Andy Murray, for instance, is nearly 28 and there is still no clue as to how to use his profile to spread the game. (Downey presented his ideas to him in Glasgow two weeks ago and was impressed by his interest.). Downey has spoken to Murray after Britain's 3-2 Davis Cup win over USA in Glasgow . TV advertising during the summer is not on the agenda. If there is an embracing of the excellent Tennis For Free charity and its proven methods then it seems limited. The whole key issue of playing surfaces did not raise a flicker, nor did the idea of adopting foreign training base with clay courts and a better climate. No participation targets have been set. The simple idea of trying to rebrand the organisation from its anachronistic 'Lawn Tennis Association' title to something more modern is apparently a non-starter for some reason. What was presented, though, was steady and sensible enough, while not especially imaginative nor wide in scope. Like most budget speeches, the effects of its contents will not be immediately obvious.", "answer": ["LTA have unveiled their long term plan to get more people playing tennis .\nThere will be 50 per cent increase in marketing budget over next four years .\nThere has been five per cent drop in adult participation over last five years .\nChief Michael Downey has spoken to Andy Murray on spreading the game ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Even the world-renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than Arsenal's 'Little Mozart' on his day.

There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0. 'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34?

Rosicky mocked up as his nickname 'Little Mozart' 87 - vs QPR (March 4) 8 - vs Everton (March 1) 9 - vs Monaco (February 25) 14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21) 18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15) That's exactly how it comes \u2013 in 'moments'.\u00a0The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift. The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League. Yet Rosicky\u00a0\u2013 a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way\u00a0\u2013 has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London. The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an\u00a0Achilles\u00a0tendon in 2012. It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since. Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates. His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker. There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension.\u00a0'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round. Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition.\u00a0His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second. You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess. Rosicky makes a no-look pass against Brighton which pundit Phil Neville found disrespectful . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it. This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any.\u00a0Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.", "answer": ["Tomas Rosicky's career has been hampered by injury at times .\nRosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' at Borussia Dortmund .\nThe 34-year-old averages just 19 games per season under Arsene Wenger .\nRosicky starred in Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002 with others such as Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Luis Figo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A British Airways pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the Germanwings disaster in the French Alps last week. Robert Brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer, and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his Boeing 747 in order to 'make a statement'. Now his victim's family say they fear that airlines have not learned from the case and are not making enough effort to assess whether pilots are genuinely fit to fly. Scroll down for video . Parallels: Robert Brown, left, threatened to crash a plane full of passengers just like Andreas Lubitz, right . Victim: Brown killed his estranged wife Joanna, pictured, by repeatedly hitting her with a claw hammer . Brown's case has chilling parallels to that of Andreas Lubitz, who last week flew a plane into the Alps, killing 150 people, after suffering from depression. He had told BA that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife Joanna, and consulted his GP about his illness, but carried on working anyway. In October 2010, Brown argued with his wife while dropping off their two children at her home in Ascot, Berkshire, and hit her 14 times with a claw hammer. He then buried her body in Windsor Great Park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by Joanna's lawyers. 'I thought something needs to be done,' Brown said. 'I thought I want to fly one last time and crash the aircraft. I wanted them to be held accountable. 'I thought if I got to work I could crash an aircraft, or fly to Lagos and crash it there or hang myself in the hotel room. I wanted to make a statement.' Sporty: Brown, a British Airways pilot, is pictured on a long-distance run in BA-branded kit . Warning: Joanna's mother Diana Parkes, right, says airlines should have learned from the case . Instead, he called in sick and another pilot stepped in to fly the BA jumbo jet to Nigeria. Brown was arrested later the same day, and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years. Joanna's mother, Diana Parkes, told the Daily Telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots cannot endanger their passengers. She said: 'Robert Brown's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear, and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from British Airways that lessons can be learnt from that.' The victim's best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton said that there were 'chilling similarities' between Brown's case and that of Lubitz, who were both fitness fanatics. Brown told his BA bosses that he was feeling stressed out, but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly, she said. Plane: Brown had been due to fly a British Airways Boeing 747 similar to this one (file photo) Similarly, Lubitz was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression, but ripped up the doctors' notes he was given excusing him from flying. Mrs Barkworth-Nanton told the Telegraph: 'Neither should have been allowed to fly and put the lives of their passengers at risk. In both cases there were things the airlines should have picked up on. The warning signs were there. 'Robert's terrible crime resulted in him taking the life of Jo, but it could have been much worse, and myself and Jo's family feel that airlines are not learning the lessons of these tragedies.' Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot out of the cockpit during Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf last Tuesday, before deliberately crashing into the Alps killing all 149 other people on board. Work to retrieve the bodies of the victims from the crash site high up in the mountains is continuing six days after the disaster.", "answer": ["Robert Brown killed wife Joanna in 2010 and was due to fly a BA Boeing 747 the next day .\nTold his murder trial he considered crashing plane 'to make a statement'\nCase has 'chilling similarities' to that of Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz .\nJoanna Brown's relatives say airlines should have learned from the case ."], "label": "SUM"}

On the eve of Bobbi Kristina\u2019s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].\u2019 In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted \u2018You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn\u2019t good enough sorry. \u2018 Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, \u2018I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.\u2019 Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub . A helping hand: Dr. Phil is concerned about Nick Gordon and his on his way to offer assistance . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother\u2019s death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston\u2019s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina\u2019s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Nick and Bobbi Kristina in happier times. Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home \u2013 a home owned by Houston until her death \u2013 as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client\u2019s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina\u2019s union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as \u2018husband\u2019 and \u2018wife\u2019 in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon \u2013 who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 \u2013 has married the girl who he once knew as a \u2018sister.\u2019 In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his \u2018wife\u2019 refers to her as his \u2018fianc\u00e9e.\u2019 What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people \u2018hitting each other and swinging\u2019 outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: \u2018Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. \u2018It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. \u2018And Nick like space, that\u2019s where a lot of the tension between them came from.\u2019 He revealed that Gordon was \u2018getting a little wild.\u2019 He said: \u2018He was getting into car accidents. He\u2019s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He\u2019s got a need for speed. He\u2019s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney\u2019s estate] and crashing them life and right. \u2018He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn\u2019t slowing down.\u2019 Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina\u2019s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter\u2019s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina\u2019s aunt Marion \u2018Pat\u2019 Houston is the executor Whitney\u2019s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read \u2018Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,\u2019 were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney\u2019s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon\u2019s \u2018sibling\u2019 relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.", "answer": ["On the eve of Bobbi Kristina\u2019s 22nd birthday yesterday Nick Gordon's tweets have become increasingly desperate and erratic .\nFriends and family are concerned about Gordon's mental health .\nThey believe Dr. Phil can help Gordon .\nGordon has not been allowed to visit with Bobbi Kristina, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated ."], "label": "SUM"}

On Tuesday, Hayes posted a link to a TED Talk by Lewinsky called 'The Price of Shame' in which the infamous former White House intern says criticizes the 'rush to judgement' in the media over revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton. 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide,' Lewinsky says.

{"question": "(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's \"Finding Jesus,\" which airs on Sundays. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page during the latest episode, \"The Gospel of Judas.\" Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Yalanda M. Price: What do scholars know about the man named Judas? What is his story? Mark Goodacre: Judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the New Testament. In fact, the relative lack of information about him in the Gospels has provided the invitation, across the centuries, for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand Jesus over to the authorities. We know very little about his back story from the Gospels. He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. In John's Gospel, he is the disciple who is concerned about Mary wasting money anointing Jesus (John 12.4-6). Soon afterward, he is arranging to hand Jesus over to the authorities. His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died (Acts 1.18-19). Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin . Kristine Spillman Adams: My understanding was always that Judas betrayed Jesus not because he was a villain, but he thought Jesus would start an earthly war when arrested. He was trying to get Jesus to establish a literal, physical kingdom on Earth. Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries of the last week of Jesus' life. What motivated Judas to betray Jesus? John hints that it was financial greed (John 12.6), and Matthew says that he betrayed Jesus for \"thirty pieces of silver\" (Matthew 27.14-15). It is true, though, that many have speculated that Judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter, and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction. With this theory, he was trying to force Jesus' hand. It has sometimes been said that perhaps the word \"Iscariot\" is a corruption of the word \"sicarii,\" which means \"dagger bearer,\" and that would provide some backing to that theory. However, John identifies Judas as \"Son of Simon Iscariot\", which makes the \"sicarii\" theory less likely. In the end, we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about Judas' motivation. Candida Moss answers your questions about John the Baptist . Betsy Wilson-Roark: Are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate? Are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous? Goodacre: That's a good question. Well, we probably have as much of the Gospel of Judas as we will ever have. Several additional fragments of the Codex Tchacos, in which the Gospel of Judas is featured, came to light after Bruce Ferrini, the dealer who owned the codex for some time, went bankrupt. Now, it is estimated that we have something like 90% to 95% of the text. With regards to translation and interpretation, this process will continue for years to come, as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts. I think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job, all the more so as they were working with an incomplete, damaged and very complex Coptic text that had been lost for centuries. But I also greatly admire April DeConick's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the Gospel that this has brought about. I was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the Gospel of Judas dramatized so effectively in \"Finding Jesus.\" Amarylis Didley West: Is there a place that we can find and read the Gospel of Judas? Goodacre: The National Geographic website on the Gospel of Judas does feature the original translation from 2006. As far as I am aware, there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation. Watch the latest episode anytime on CNNgo . NJ Robinson: Good question would be did Jesus know Judas would betray him when/before he chose him? Goodacre: The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus (more accurately \"hand him over\") as soon as they introduce him (e.g. Mark 3.19), but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical Jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction. If you would like to read more about Judas, a good starting point is provided in this article on the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey website.  It is written by \"Finding Jesus\" contributor Bruce Chilton. And if you would like to read more about the Gospel of Judas, \"Finding Jesus\" contributor April DeConick discusses it on Bible Odyssey.

{"question": "Michael Clarke hit a supreme 74 as the departing Australian captain led his country to World Cup glory against New Zealand with a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne on Sunday. A crowd of 93,013 witnessed Australia claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one-sided. New Zealand were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below-par 183 in 45 overs, despite 83 from Grant Elliott \u2013 as Mitchell Starc bowled Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over.

Australia captain Michael Clarke (right) shakes hands with Brendon McCullum after being dismissed for 74 . New Zealand's players look dejected after their disappointing innings cost them the chance of glory in Melbourne . In response, Clarke and Steve Smith shared a 112-run third-wicket partnership as Australia cruised to victory in 34 overs. McCullum called right at the toss and on a sun-bathed Melbourne Cricket Ground the New Zealand captain understandably chose to bat. So often the 33-year-old\u2019s own innings sets the tempo of the Black Caps innings and on Sunday it was no different. Having come out swinging and twice been beaten, McCullum was bowled for a duck by a full, in-swinging Starc delivery that cannoned into off-stump. It sent the MCG crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a World Cup final for the first time ever. Aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen New Zealand boast an average run-rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but Australia\u2019s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one. Clarke\u2019s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive Glenn Maxwell bowled Martin Guptill (15) with just his second ball. And six balls later New Zealand were reduced to 39 for three as Kane Williamson departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive Johnson but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler. It was the perfect start for Australia and Clarke remained on the attack with two new New Zealand batsman at the crease. But Ross Taylor and semi-final hero Elliott steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild, with the latter top-edging Starc for a 72-meter six into the leg side. The pair shared a 111-run fourth-wicket partnership and looked to have brought New Zealand back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse. James Faulkner, who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers, was brought back into the attack and immediately had Taylor caught behind for 40. The 24-year-old Tasmanian deceived the batsman with a slower ball and Brad Haddin took an exceptional low catch, diving to his right, with the ball dying on him. Two balls later the heavy-hitting Corey Anderson was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps. A double-wicket maiden in a World Cup is impressive, a double-wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match-winning moment. Five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi\u2019s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged Starc to Michael Clarke at first slip for a four-ball duck \u2013 the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run. Meanwhile, Elliott \u2013 fresh from his semi-final match-winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before.

And, whereas Clarke\u2019s one-day international swansong was going to plan Daniel Vettori could only muster nine before a full in-swinging yorker from Johnson hit the 36-year-old\u2019s pad and rattled onto the stumps. New Zealand were crumbling and Elliott having effortlessly moved to 83 became Faulkner\u2019s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by Haddin. When needed most, the Black Caps tail failed to wag and the final wicket run-out perfectly summed up both side\u2019s days up to that point. Boult defended a short Johnson ball to Maxwell at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker\u2019s stumps. Tim Southee\u2019s bat stuck in the ground and he was run-out, as New Zealand stumbled to 183 all out. It was telling that Australia leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line-up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field. Early wickets were going to be vital if New Zealand were going to make their first World Cup final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler, Boult, delivered.

Both Australia and New Zealand stand for the national anthems at a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday . Aaron Finch attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads, up into the air and into the waiting Boult\u2019s hands. The Kiwi fans, silent for large parts of the first innings, were now making themselves heard but David Warner soon quieted them once again. Warner found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46-balls before Matt Henry claimed his first wicket of the World Cup having batsman caught at deep square leg, attempting to pull the ball. The loss of the second Australian wicket put McCullum back into an aggressive mindset and Clarke was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30-yard circle. But the right-handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked Southee for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from Henry, having made 74 off 72-balls. And, Smith (56 not out) hit his fifth consecutive half-century as the MCG erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun. It was a disappointing end for New Zealand who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the World Cup. But the day and night belonged to the Australians who once again were crowned as the best one-day team in the world.", "answer": ["New Zealand batted first but set Australia a target of just 184 to win after a disappointing innings .\nBrendon McCullum, Kane Williamson and Martin Guptill were all out early for Mike Hesson's side .\nAaron Finch fell in the second over but Australia regained control through Steve Smith and David Warner .\nCaptain Michael Clarke managed 74 before being bowled by Matt Henry just before the finish .\nSmith scored the decisive runs for Australia as they regained the trophy they last won in 2007 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Robert Durst's family is so scared of the suspected-murderer that they have taken out a restraining order against him, even though he is currently behind bars without bail. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000. Prosecutors have charged Durst with capital murder,\u00a0making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst's (left, in mugshot taken Saturday) family has taken out a restraining order against him, in the wake of his recent arrest on murder charges. Durst's brother Douglas pictured on the right in November 2014. In the state of California, murder convicts can only be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if prosecutors prove that the murder was carried out with a 'special circumstance'. In Durst's case, the alleged special circumstances include killing a witness and lying in wait. Last year, California's death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, but the state will likely appeal the decision. The last time a California death row inmate was executed was in 2006. Durst, 71, was recently the center of HBO documentary The Jinx, and in the final episode which aired Sunday, appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. But Los Angeles Police say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the recording. The latest protective order prohibits Durst from communicating with brother Douglas, his wife Susanne, their children Helena and Alexander, as well as their respective spouses and children. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Durst must stay away from their offices and homes - something he has had difficulty doing in the past. Durst was the recent subject of HBO documentary The Jinx. In the final episode, which aired Sunday, he appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. LAPD say his arrest on Saturday has nothing to do with the show . In April 2013, Durst was arrested for lurking outside of his brother's house. The Jinx follows Durst's long fued with his younger brother Douglas, who father Seymour named head of the multi-billion-dollar family corporation. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Douglas issued a statement on behalf of the family which reads: 'We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.' In addition to the death of Susan Berman, Durst has been linked to the disappearance of his wife Kathleen in 1982, and the homicide of his elderly neighbor Morris Black. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder after claiming he killed and then dismembered the neighbor out of self defense. He is currently being held without bond since he is considered a flight risk. Authorities are currently in the process of extraditing Durst from New Orleans to Los Angeles where the most recent charges were filed.", "answer": ["The restraining order prohibits Durst from contacting brother Douglas, and other members of Douglas' family .\nDurst, 71, was arrested on Saturday on charges of first-degree murder for the execution-style slaying of his friend Susan Berman in 2000 .\nThe former real-estate heir was the focus of recent HBO documentary The Jinx .\nIn the final episode, which aired Sunday, Durst appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks his microphone is turned off .\nLAPD say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the documentary ."], "label": "SUM"}

He has some particular things that he leads on, that Johnny Sexton does, that Rob Kearney does, Peter O'Mahony, we have got a number of provincial leaders, Rory Best, who step up and take different roles of leadership.

Sexton's predecessor and long-time team mate of O'Connell, Ronan O'Gara added: 'Paul is very, very special in terms of the ability to deliver the right message at the right time.' That quality will be especially handy in the red-hot cauldron of the Millennium Stadium where Wales, after their opening loss to England, have put themselves back in contention for the title.

But more recently, he says, \"the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic.\" So what's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names, replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages? Look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. Psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded, adventurous individuals in search of new experiences. Hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly. \"Hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way,\" says Matthew Von Ertfelda, Marriott's vice president for insight, strategy and innovation. The explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game. Brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global, online world, say the pros. \"Thanks to social media, millennials are the first global generation,\" says Dr. Donna Quadri-Felitti, academic chair of New York University's School of Professional Studies Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. \"And since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting, hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world.\" For social media purposes, the number of characters in a name counts. Spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity. But another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal. Spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable. \"The odder the name, the less likely someone has already captured it,\" says Cornell professor Dev. \"That's important in terms of intellectual property protection.\" It may explain why Venu and Vib are missing an \"e.\" Venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand, launching its first property in Dubai in 2017. According to parent company Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, it's designed to give travelers \"the freedom to write their own story, their own narrative, to build their own scene.\" Best Western's new hotel entry, called Vib, is pronounced \"vibe.\" \"We tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality, while also connoting a vibrant spirit,\" says Dick Lew, a partner at Houston-based Acumen Design, a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image. Hence Vib, which is derived from \"vibrant.\" Color also plays a big part in hotel branding. \"We incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo, in order to reflect the (Vib) brand's bold personality,\" says Lew. Moxy, the new Marriott partnership with IKEA, is going after \"a sassy, determined, individualistic consumer,\" according to Marriott's Von Ertfelda. The first Moxy opened at Milan's Malpensa Airport in September and more are coming in Europe this year. \"Naming Moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming,\" says Von Ertfelda. \"Once we came up with it, we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot. \"At the same time, though, our lawyers noted the name had to be 'ownable and trademarkable.'\" The change of spelling from moxie to Moxy achieved that. According to Von Ertfelda, senior creative director Maria Rezende-Heiston selected hot pink for the Moxy logo to \"appeal to those who aren't afraid to express themselves\" while using a \"curved font to convey a sense of rhythm, fluidity and independence.\" Color is also key to hotel operator Carlson Rezidor, which is hueing (sic) toward Red and Blu. Blu came about in 2009, after airline SAS withdrew from a partnership with Radisson. After the split, Radisson SAS, a collection of European design hotels, needed a new name. \"We wanted to replace SAS with an equally short name,\" says Rose Anderson, vice president of branding for the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. \"We liked using blue from the old SAS logo, because it brought in the heritage of the former brand. \"At the same time, we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world's favorite color.\" So blue or bleu became Blu, a trademarkable spelling. Carlson Rezidor recently announced a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, \"build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson's brand awareness.\" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there's nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides \"five-star beds at a one-star price.\" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany's Steigenberger Hotel Group's Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be \"hip and happening hotels\" that \"move to the rhythm of today's curious global traveler\" who has a \"desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel.\" You can't explore the hospitality industry's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood. The brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998. \"Starwood was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand,\" says Paul James, global brand leader of W Hotels Worldwide, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. W's target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic. Starwood defined the brand by adding its \"Whatever, Whenever\" tagline to the simple W logo. Cornell's Dev says Starwood further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty, warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material. More than 15 years later, the W Hotel brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide. Journalist Laura Powell started covering the travel industry for CNN in the 1980s.

{"question": "The Prince of Wales and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, ended their second day in the U.S. with a glitzy night out with friends in Washington D.C. The couple, who will celebrate their 10th anniversary next month, put on their best dress for a dinner hosted by Barby Allbritton, the head of the prince's charity in the U.S. and the widow of Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico. The Allbrittons were so close to the British royals that they were two of a few Americans invited to the Royal Wedding between Charles' son Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Charles and Camilla joined Mrs Allbritton, her son Robert - who now runs Politico - and his wife Elena for the black tie charity affair on Wednesday night. The event was so secretive that other guests were only given the address earlier in the day,\u00a0PageSix reported.

Charles and Camilla still look bright-eyed as they arrived at the party despite a whirlwind day  visiting D.C.'s landmarks and George Washington's plantation before delving into environmental policy. At a meeting of the Global Ocean Commission and the International Sustainability Unit - a charitable group established by the prince to address environmental concerns - Charles spoke about the dangers of accumulating plastic waste in the world's oceans. 'Although the evidence surrounding the links between plastic waste and human health are not yet clear, I would tentatively suggest that they are unlikely to be beneficial,'he said during his 10-minute speech at the Hay Adams hotel. Charles said that he was \u2018haunted\u2019 and \u2018horrified\u2019 by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations.

His impassioned speech came after he and his wife took time out to play tourists. On Wednesday morning, the couple wrapped up against the brisk temperatures for their 20-minute tour of the Martin Luther King memorial and paused to read his quotations engraved in the stone. 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that,' read one quotation where the royal couple paused to see King's words from 1963. Harry Johnson, the president of the foundation that built the King memorial, said he gave the royal couple a stone from the memorial's granite as a gift.

Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis. 'To come here and have such a joyful event was just really incredible luck on our part,' she said. Camilla, who was showing off a chic new hairstyle, obligingly stopped for a selfie before continuing on with U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell by her side. Charles and Camilla were then whisked off to Mount Vernon, where they were met by the Governor and First Lady of Virginia, Terry and Dorothy McAuliffe.

The document, a successor to the original 1209 charter, was reissued by Edward I as a quid pro quo for extra funds with which to wage war on Scotland. It was also on a tour of the National Archives that Charles learned his uncle once developed a new polo stick.  National Archivist David Ferriero presented the prince with a patent application submitted in 1931 by his uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, for a new kind of polo stick. Charles, himself a polo player, laughed and said he had no idea that his uncle had designed a polo stick. He also laughed when shown a telegram from the U.S. embassy in London to the Secretary of State, sent in 1957 seeking instructions to ensure that a toy car that had been given to Charles, then 8 years old, would be working properly when he returned home to play with it.

{"question": "A 66-year-old man told his wife that he feared hospital staff were 'trying to kill him' a day before they put him on a 'do not resuscitate' notice without the consent of his family, an inquest has heard. Michael Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died at\u00a0James Paget University Hospital in\u00a0Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,  after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow said. The great-grandfather, who died in October 2013, had been ill for several years with a lung condition which caused his breathing to stop but had been given more than a year to live. Heartbroken: Michael Richardson died at James Paget University Hospital after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow, Janet (pictured with her late husband) said told an inquest today. Right, Mr Richardson . Giving evidence at an inquest, his widow, Janet, said her husband had tried to discharge himself the day before his death after becoming concerned about the levels of oxygen he was being given. Speaking at the inquest in Norfolk, she said: 'He said, \"I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me\". 'I said, \"I love you\", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive. 'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.' The 66-year-old accused medics of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family. The inquest heard the family, who had recently moved to Norfolk from Deal, Kent, only learned of the notice when they picked up Mr Richardson's death certificate from the hospital four days after he died. Janet Richardson (centre, with a photo of Mr Richardson) with daughters Jocelin Taylor (left) and Antonia Richardson (right). The widow claimed she only learned of the DNR order four days after her husband's death . Asked by assistant coroner David Osborne if she had given consent for this, Mrs Richardson said: 'No, nothing at all.' She added: 'I visited the hospital twice a day.  There would have been loads of opportunities for staff to talk to me. If he had been asked about the DNR notice, he would have said no, I know that. 'He used to say, \"some life is better than no life, you're a long time dead\". He was well aware he would die at some point, just not that quickly.' Mr Richardson, who was born in Islington, London, was diagnosed with the lung-scarring condition pulmonary fibrosis  in 2008 and received oxygen therapy at home. On October 24 2013, his condition deteriorated and his family called an ambulance which took him to the hospital. Mrs Richardson said he had been moved between various wards and when she visited him he 'seemed worse than when he went in'. Although his medical notes correctly identified pulmonary fibrosis as his main condition, he was initially treated for emphysema, Mrs Richardson said. When she pointed this out, doctors increased his oxygen levels. She also described how her husband had been left to lie on soiled sheets and was not being regularly washed. Care: Mrs Richardson accused medics at James Paget University Hospital of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family . Nurse Louise Curtis described how staff had initially rushed to resuscitate Mr Richardson after an emergency alarm was activated. But as they tried to save his life, a colleague checked his notes and pointed out the DNR notice so they stopped these efforts. She added that staffing levels that day had been 'unusually low' with herself and two agency nurses responsible for 27 patients. Normally the ward would have been staffed by four or five nurses.", "answer": ["Michael Richardson, 66, died at James Paget University Hospital in 2013 .\nHe had been ill for five years but had been given more than a year to live .\nHe tried to discharge himself day before his death, his widow told inquest .\nShe said he'd raised concerns over amount of oxygen he was being given .\nFour days after his death, Mrs Richardson found out about DNR notice .\nShe said family had not consented and accused medics of playing God .\nNurse on-duty at the time today described staff levels as 'unusually low'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Those who would love to see the lesser spotted Laura Robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation. Having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week\u2019s Miami Open, she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month\u2019s WTA Tour event in Bogota, and the new target for her return appears to be the French Open in May. That suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again, having not played since the Australian Open in January last year. Former British No 1 Laura Robson protects her wrist while out in London . Nobody is more frustrated about this than Robson herself, now 21 and without a world ranking. She would dearly love to be in Miami now, but instead is back practising over in Bradenton near Tampa at the IMG Academy. Perhaps encouragingly, she posted a picture of herself on Twitter doing a full, tendon-testing handstand. Robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career, which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in Melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery. Here this week her manager, Max Eisenbud, issued a positive-sounding update while preaching patience: \u201cI\u2019m happy with the way it\u2019s been going and she\u2019s been hitting the ball great in practice,\u201d he said. \u201c It\u2019s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. It\u2019s all about when she is ready to compete. We don\u2019t want to put her in a situation where she can\u2019t play a full tournament.\u201d Among Eisenbud\u2019s other clients include Maria Sharapova, whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach. \u201cI learned a lot from the whole experience with Maria, and that\u2019s why I feel strongly about not rushing it. Laura is still young with a lot of time ahead.\u201d Sharapova seems to have won her battle, but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for Robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident. When she finally decided to go for surgery last April to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who has had operations on both wrists. She used the same specialist at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota. Ironically this has turned out to be the Argentine\u2019s own comeback event and on Thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to Vasek Pospisil. The fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an abortive return in January shows just how infernally complex wrist injuries are for tennis players. He was just delighted to be back on court: \u201cIt's not 100% free, but I felt even better than Sydney tournament in January,\u201d he said. \u201c It's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist. I feel better week by week, but it's still very early to feel 100%. \u201cMentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm, looking forward for the future. I'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon. I want to play tennis. It doesn't matter how long it's take me to be in the top again.\u201d Being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves. An example of this is 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva, who was out for 17 months following the 2012 Olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery. Robson has sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro . Del Potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the Miami Open . Since returning at the start of last year the talented Russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153. She lost another first round here this week. So it could be hard for Robson whenever she returns, although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker. That much was clear when, enjoying a rare spell free from injury, she became the first British player since Jo Durie to reach the world\u2019s top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19. It might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return. When she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in Nike after being dropped by adidas, and will be coached by Colombian Mauricio Hadad, a former guide of Heather Watson.

Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban. Liam Fisher, 22,  tried valiantly to save his comrade, and was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him. Rosie-Ann Stone has married Private Liam Fisher, who risked his own life trying to save her fatally injured brother in Afghanistan . But he could not be saved, and the young soldier died of his wounds at the scene. His sister Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, heard of Pte Fisher's bravery at her brother's inquest and the couple stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages. They soon realised they were falling for each other and the couple got engaged last November. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, was so moved by the story of the family that he granted a special licence for the couple to marry in York Minster in a moving ceremony held yesterday.

{"question": "(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. \"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\" Riley said. \"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\" she said. \"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \"We're still working with them to get good data,\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\" she said.", "answer": ["FDA official says Olympus never got permission to sell its endoscope .\nMedical device is connected to CRE outbreak in California that's left two people dead ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Hidden in a vault in Marrakesh, it has been one of the most highly-anticipated albums in music history. And tonight, after six years, the Wu-Tang Clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - before sealing it away once more. In an attempt to break free from the Spotify and YouTube era of freely-shared music, rap's most influential collective is selling the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. After a private online-only sale this month through art dealers Paddle8 - which employs Britain's Princess Eugenie - the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with the group's de facto leader RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103. Scroll down for video . Unprecendented: This is the Wu-Tang Clan's record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin that was played on Monday night to a small group before it is sold and kept secret until the year 2103. It has been six years in the making . The record comes in a silver, jeweled box with a specially-designed wax seal and a leather-bound book . The box: It was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation . The Staten Island-born group revived the East Coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s . Confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance, Cher's voice bellowed out during the 13-minute extract.\u00a0And though it wasn't played, DailyMail.com understands it to be true that Barcelona FC players also make a cameo appearance. Typical of the group's first record 36 Chambers, it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples, clips of dialogue from movies, and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder. Reiterating its own grandeur, there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say, 'this has never been done before.' All of the Staten Island clan's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts. The record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in Morocco, with a seal designed and printed by wax-smiths in Serbia. 'This has never been done before,' RZA told DailyMail.com after playing the record. 'Music is just handed out now, the industry is in crisis. People feel like they deserve to have it for free. This is art. You can take a picture of the Mona Lisa but that's not art. 'The same with this: you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing.' The pre-sale event played up to the idea. Those invited were subjected to airport-style security checks, and electronic devices were confiscated. In a dark room, buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played. The nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight, with two bodyguards standing either side. While some  were fans, others were advisers who hailed from as far as Asia to inspect the 'artwork'. One adviser for a Chinese collector, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like Wu-Tang or not. The box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining. Inside, is a cinematic-style record, plus a leather-bound 174-page manuscript printed on gilded Fedrigoni Marina parchment with lyrics, credits, tales about the recording. The adviser said: 'Someone said it would be worth $1 million. That's nothing. This is something completely different; completely new. I don't think I could put a price on it. 'The concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history... It is huge.' The Wu-Tang Clan formed in the early 1990s, reviving the East Coast's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop. RZA - pronounced 'rizza' - drew together nine MCs, including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms Ol' Dirty Bastard and GZA. The remaining slots were filled by Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck. Ambition: RZA, n\u00e9\u00a0Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, wants the long-awaited album to be treated like a work of art . Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA (pictured) but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougar . The new album pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry . With industry domination in their sights, RZA saw that each member of the Clan was signed with different production companies, while maintaining their loyalty as a group. Their first album, 36 Chambers, was hailed as unprecedented, with samples from soul music and kung fu movies. Spanning 128 minutes, the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in Staten Island, New York, and hark back to their original mid-90s lyrics about the Shaolin. It features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers. And as for Cher's cameo appearance, RZA said: 'Did nobody ever have a crush on Cher? She's the ultimate. Ain't nobody like Cher.' Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougarh - a Wu-Tang fan who visited the group's New York office five times until they took him on. Cilvaringz explains he and RZA were already developing the concept of a record charting the Wu's history when the music industry changed completely. Once Upon A Time In Shaolin has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the Wu's Shaolin symbol and a decorative design by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist . Collectively, the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other . Within five years singles plummeted to the price of $0.99, and artists were streaming their work for free. Simultaneously, Cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in Morocco, where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars. 'That [was] the first time I asked myself: \"Why and how are these artists valued at such a price?\" People like Dre or Kanye or RZA are geniuses in what they do, and their music is valued at 99 cents. 'No disrespect to Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Damien Hirst, or any other artists, but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly, \"Do you know Damien Hirst? Do you know Basquiat?\" they'll say \"Who?\" If you say, \"Do you know Dr. Dre? Do you know Kanye?,\" they'll say \"Yeah.\"' The album, he says, pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry. The group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts, thereby dominating the recording industry . 36 Chambers: This was the collective's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene . And despite years of disputes erupting between the clan's members, RZA insists that there was 'no tension' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album, adding 'the eight members, excluding myself, are the most talented MCs I have ever encountered. They are true artists because they aren't taught. You can't teach art.' Speaking later with Genius executive editor Sasha Frere-Jones, RZA described his ambitions: 'Maybe Richard Branson will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet. That'd be dope!' However, Cilvaringz conceded, the fact that the buyer cannot commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free. 'I hope they don't,' RZA said. 'This is unique and something only has value if it is rare.'", "answer": ["Wu-Tang Clan is selling new album for millions of dollars via Paddle8 .\nSole buyer cannot share much-anticipated\u00a0double LP for at least 88 years .\nOn Monday night, group played the album to a few in Queens, New York .\nDailyMail.com among those to hear it for first - and last time before 2103 .\nRZA described the music as 'exclusive' and 'piece of contemporary art'\nCher  appears on the record because 'who didn't have a crush on Cher?'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It has been a multi-million pound rescue mission lasting 12 years, but 900-year-old Cardigan Castle, in Wales, is set open its doors to visitors once more in April. Tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to the historic castle, to see the results of the\u00a0Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust project. It is set to be a lavish affair, with 3,000 daffodils and 1,700 rolls of turf planted in celebration of the occasion. Cardigan Castle is set to open in April, after an \u00a312m renovation.\u00a0It is hoped that the Castle will become one of west Wales\u2019 top tourist destinations, attracting at least 33,000 visitors in the first year . The castle, which has been unoccupied since 1996, will open its doors to visitors in April, following an extensive \u00a312m restoration project which began in 2011 . The new lease of life for the castle includes the recreation of the paths and lawns of the regency gardens, a  glass restaurant with panoramic views over the River Teifi, and the restoration of the whalebone arch \u2013 a popular feature for early 19th Century gardens. The impressive landmark has a fascinating history, from being build as a wooden Iron Age settlement by Gilbert de Clare in 1100, to enduring medieval battles between Normans and Welsh rebels, and hosting Wales' first Eisteddfod in 1176. The last inhabitant was\u00a0Barbara Wood, who sold the castle in 2001 after residing there for almost 60 years. The redevelopment of the site has included the recreation of the paths and lawns of the Regency gardens and the fitting of a floor-to-ceiling glass restaurant . In 1165, The Lord Rhys and his Welsh army captured the castle and Cardigan became the first town in the country to be occupied by the Welsh . The design of some elements of the stone castle were inspired by the crusades and are the earliest examples of this work in the UK . The summer will feature events including an open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the castle, the people who lived there, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod . The castle was purchased by the council in 2003 and began being repaired as part of the regeneration of Cardigan by the CBPT charity. Jann Tucker, chair of CBPT, who was recently awarded an MBE for her efforts in preserving Welsh heritage, said: 'It's been a long time coming but the finishing post is nearly in sight. We have worked so long and so hard for this. 'The Castle will really put Cardigan on the map.' Through extensive refurbishment, and many hours work from numerous volunteers, the derelict site has been transformed into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue. The renovation has transformed the house, previously inhabited by Barbara Wood, and restored the building for guests. Barbara was the last person to live in the castle and moved to the site as a young girl in July 1940 . Situated on raised ground overlooking the River Teifi, the site of Cardigan Castle has been an ideal location for thousands of years. This was confirmed by archaeologists in 2012 when Neolithic flint scrapers were unearthed in the castle\u2019s grounds . Cardigan Castle has seen many battles over the years. A lesser known siege took place in 1138 when the Welsh attacked the Norman base with the help of Viking mercenaries . Cris Tomos, Castle Director, said: 'We're busy putting the finishing touches in place and are looking forward to opening ahead of the May bank holidays and summer school break. 'And there's plenty to attract visitors to the Castle over the summer months, with an exciting programme of events, from open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the Castle, the people who lived here, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod.' Funding for the grand project came from the Heritage Lottery Fund (\u00a36m) and European Regional Development Fund (\u00a34.3m), with the rest provided by other council and heritage trust funds.

{"question": "(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see. \"She was barely conscious. It was very hard to keep her attention at the moment,\" Sawyer told CNN's Erin Burnett. \" And she was covered in blood. It was one of the most horrific crime scenes I have seen.\" The officer grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to find where she was injured. Michelle Wilkins was weak and in shock when police arrived. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. \"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,\" Sawyer said. \"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now.\" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. \"When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it.\" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. \"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,\" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, \"She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.\" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who \"saved her own life.\" The fetus died, but the mother survived and \"is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,\" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, \"We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.\" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.", "answer": ["Officers responding to 911 call found Michelle Wilkins covered in blood .\nWilkins was stabbed and had fetus torn out after she answered a Craigslist ad ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed Al-Jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow. Al-Jumaili's wife was with them taking photos. Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and \"just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.\" There is \"extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,\" said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of \"a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.\" Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether  Al-Jumaili was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out, Al-Jumaili cried \"I'm hit!\" according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim's relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where Al-Jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot. Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and Al-Jumaili and his family. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males. Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon. Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. \"We can't solve this crime alone,\" he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said. Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it. She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family's expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward.

{"question": "Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work in a few seconds of mindless vandalism . This is the shocking moment a gang of bullies set fire to a schoolgirl's GCSE coursework - before sending her a video of the cruel prank. Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work. The 15-year-old had not realised the work was missing until she was sent the video by her tormentors - who were suspended for just three days after the act of mindless vandalism. The footage shows the teenage bullies laughing and joking as they poured lighter fluid over the pile of papers on a picnic bench and set it alight. One boy even attempted to fan the flames by spraying it with a deodorant can while another threw in a lighter which eventually caused the notes to explode. A pupil then climbed onto the bench to trample over the cindered books. Police yesterday were investigating after the footage was posted online, but confirmed there had been no arrests so far. Rhiannon said she has been the victim of a campaign of bullying at Easthampstead Park Community School in Bracknell, Berkshire, since last September and\u00a0suffered from anxiety and depression as a result. She now fears the stunt may put her entry to college in jeopardy. She said: 'I was shocked and disgusted when I was sent the video by one of the pupils involved. None of them seems to be sorry for what they have done or show any regret. I am just very upset and tearful that all my hard work has gone to waste. 'I have always wanted to work with children and it is what I had set my heart on doing for the rest of my life. I am not even sure if I can get a place on my course at the college anymore. I can't understand why anyone would do this.' The  teenager, who dreams of a career as a nursery nurse, was just two weeks away from submitting the coursework when the bullies destroyed her work. One of the bullies shouts 'put a lighter on it' as another prepares to set fire to\u00a0Rhiannon's coursework . Two boys reel away as the flaming pile of notes explodes thanks to a lighter that had been thrown on them . Her mother, Debbie Groom, said: 'I am so angry. These pupils have ruined my daughter's life. I would be mortified if that was my child carrying out that sort of behaviour. 'This incident is going to scar Rhiannon for life. She has been very stressed and upset but the reaction to the video being posted online has been amazing - it just shows that people do not like bullies.' Another pupil, 15-year-old Kayleigh Holloway from Hanworth, also had her child development coursework destroyed in the pile. Her uncle Neil Holloway said: 'I am disgusted by what has happened. I don't think the three days suspension given to the children involved was not enough punishment. 'They have all probably seen it as a nice holiday. Even though the school has said her grades won't be affected that is not the answer or what we want to hear. 'Kayleigh was very upset when she found out - she has got enough going on in her life without all of this.' Rihannon's mother Debbie Groom (pictured with Rhiannon's family, L-R: \u00a0aunt Anne Yates, mother Debbie Groom, Rhiannon Blair and her sister Katie Blair) said the incident had scarred her daughter for life . Headteacher Liz Cook said letters had been sent out to everybody involved in the incident and assured the victims that their grades would not be affected. She said: 'The school has investigated the incident at length and its origins were a falling out between girls, property was taken as a spiteful act designed to disrupt the victim's lesson the following day. 'On reflection students have realised this act was a huge error of judgement on their part and have been shocked that their act has attracted a social media storm.

{"question": "A CEO who reportedly died of a heart attack in Venezuela two years ago has been arrested on fraud charges after being captured by the FBI at his remote North Carolina hideout. Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested on Saturday wearing a brown toupee and a dyed beard. Each count carries a possible 30-year sentence. Just a few years ago, Lantigua's family appeared to be living the American Dream. The Cuban immigrant claimed he had a heroic military career and earned numerous degrees before running a successful furniture business. He owned a Florida beachfront condo and a new home atop a verdant North Carolina mountain. But in 2012, as his Circle K Furniture company slid deeper into debt, those who knew Lantigua said he'd made some odd decisions: he ordered tons of new furniture on the company dime for his family's many homes. Scroll down for video . Jose Lantigua and wife Daphne Wilson celebrating New Year's Eve 2013. Three months later, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela, his body cremated there instead of returned home. He was arrested this weekend on fraud charges in North Carolina . Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . FBI agents execute a search warrant at the Sapphire, North Carolina, home of Jose Lantigua on Monday. Lantigua, a Jacksonville businessman reported dead two years ago in Venezuela, was arrested in North Carolina on Saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they shouldn't be making payments . He replaced the bookkeeper he'd used for years with a relative. He built a panic room with steel doors inside his North Carolina hideaway. And, prosecutors say, he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $8 million from insurance companies. No matter how the criminal case turns out, his arrest gives a resolute end to a long-running court battle between Lantigua's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because, for many reasons proven right, they didn't think he was dead. 'I've never seen anything quite like (this case),' said Joe Licandro, a Jacksonville prosecutor working the case. 'There was always a suspicion, but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did, and she didn't have any missteps either - until recently.' Lantigua, who had emigrated to the U.S. as a youth, purchased Circle K Furniture in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the U.S. Army, where he claimed to have earned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest military honor for bravery. Jose Antigua with his heavily-pregnant daughter Christina on New Year's Eve 2013 before he allegedly faked his own death. Friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father's reported passing in 2013 . Months after her father's alleged passing, Christina Lantigua posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below. Neither the businessman's daughter or son, Joseph, have been charged with a crime . The Army has not responded to requests for confirmation. He also graduated from Florida International University in 1989 with a degree in computer science, the school said, and claimed degrees in management, mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from Pepperdine University, Northwestern University and the University of Florida, respectively. UF said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and Northwestern had no record of him. Pepperdine did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. By the time Lantigua bought Circle K Furniture, it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large Jacksonville showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country-style pieces made from logs. Problems surfaced in 2012, when Lantigua told friends and colleagues he'd fallen ill and needed to go to Venezuela to get an experimental treatment not available in the United States. Simpson stood by his side with an expression of worry, people who know the couple said. Records showed they sold their Jacksonville-area condo for $600,000. About this time, Circle K was also developing financial problems. No one suspected anything suspicious at first, said Kathleen Leis, who was Circle K's bookkeeper. But as the company's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said Lantigua kept buying furniture for his family with company funds. Still, she trusted the man, whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems. Then Lantigua replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister-in-law. 'I wasn't given a reason except I was needed more on the floor and his sister-in-law couldn't sell furniture,' she said. Before long, Lantigua headed to Venezuela to deal with his alleged illness. Lantigua ran the once successful Circle K furniture company (pictured) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 . Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, are jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home. Circle K's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy. Lantigua's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $8 million in policies he'd obtained. At his June 2013 memorial service at High Point Community Church in suburban Jacksonville, Lantigua's daughter, Christina, sang 'Amazing Grace' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on. Meanwhile, American General Life Companies had suspicions about the $2 million claim Lantigua's son, Joseph, had filed, particularly the Venezuelan death and cremation certificates accompanying it. First, the physician who signed Lantigua's death certificate never received or examined the body. The investigators also said there had been no autopsy. Finally, the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where Lantigua supposedly died. Investigators found that suspicious. 'The insured's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures,' American General said in court documents. The crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents, the company said. Last November, American General denied the claim and lawsuits were filed. Joseph Lantigua has not responded to several phone messages  seeking comment. No contact information for Christina Lantigua could be found. Neither has been charged with a crime. American General's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors, who opened an investigation that included surveillance. At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville. 'It's possible that he's been hiding out there these past couple of years,' said Licandro, the Jacksonville prosecutor. Residents of the nearby village of Sapphire said the area is perfect for hiding out: only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves. But Lantigua apparently thought trouble was coming. He built a bunker in his basement complete with 20-inch thick steel doors, said a contractor who worked on the house. 'It made me wonder why would you need a panic (room) here? There's not that many people around here you got to worry about,' said Forrest Boutte, 28. Boutte said Lantigua was a nice, straightforward man. On Saturday, U.S. State Department security agents arrested Lantigua near the Hogback Mountain home. The passport he had used to get back into the U.S. had proved his downfall. The man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black \u2014 the photo Lantigua submitted showed he is white. The Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917. Suspicious, State Department agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity. Finding him wasn't hard \u2014 while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged, he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct North Carolina address. For those who knew him, the news that he was still alive was startling. 'I'm just shocked. He didn't seem that type at all. He seemed to me an upstanding, Christian family man. He was nice to everybody and wanted help people,' Leis said. It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home (pictured) At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville .", "answer": ["Jose Lantigua, 62, and wife, Daphne Simpson, 57, jailed on insurance fraud charges after he was arrested by FBI on Saturday in North Carolina .\nIn April 2013, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela and his body cremated there instead of returned home .\nThe passport Lantigua used was his downfall - the man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black .\nThe Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Jonny Evans' actions in spitting at Papiss Cisse were 'simply disgusting', a Football Association regulatory commission ruled. The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.' The written report also reveals Manchester United questioned the length of the suspension but the commission did not consider there were any 'truly exceptional' circumstances to reduce it from the standard six matches.", "answer": ["Jonny Evans was banned for six games for spitting at Papiss Cisse .\nFA commission which found him guilty have published written reasons .\nReport said Evans was 'looking directly and indeed aggressively at Cisse'\n'The ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting'"], "label": "SUM"}
