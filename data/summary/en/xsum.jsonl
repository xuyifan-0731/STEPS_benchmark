The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961.\nBy 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute.\nHe went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941.\nBy the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy.\nHaving bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators.\nHe also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking.\nThe Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack.\nStigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy.\nBut he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd.\n\"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.

{"question": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nAccies survived some nervous moments before Ash Taylor headed the Dons ahead after 34 minutes.\nBut the lead only lasted four minutes as Dougie Imrie scored from the penalty spot after Danny Redmond was challenged by goalkeeper Joe Lewis.\nRooney pounced when Gary Woods parried a James Maddison shot, before Accies' Scott McMann was shown a late red card.\nThe win - thanks to the Irish striker's 11th goal this season - takes Aberdeen to within four points of second-placed Rangers in the Scottish Premiership table.\nAccies remain second bottom without a victory in 10 games since beating the Dons in October.\nAberdeen were fluid and dangerous from the off, exposing Accies' weakness on the left flank, with Louis Longridge inexperienced in a full-back role against Jonny Hayes.\nMark Reynolds netted early on, but referee Andrew Dallas saw pushing and ruled it out, perhaps a touch harshly as the Dons defender didn't appear to be the culprit.\nIt seemed only a matter of time for the home side, with visiting defenders struggling to cope with the recurring threat.\nOne corner in particular caused chaos involving a Reynolds header that was saved, an overhead kick clearance and a follow up effort from Andrew Considine with the ball eventually forced behind.\nChances and corners flowed. Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.\nThe breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.\nIncredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.\nTaylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.\nThe goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.\nAberdeen responded well to that set-back, with Woods superbly tipping Taylor's drive over before Rooney appeared to be pushed in the box, but pleas were ignored.\nThe Dons went forward relentlessly. Manager Derek McInnes made a positive move, bringing on Maddison for Considine and it proved decisive.\nIt was Maddison's shot that Woods palmed back into play perfectly for the onrushing Rooney to net.\nMcMann prevented a third, hauling Hayes to the ground just outside the box that earned a red card with the winger in on goal.\nNo-one could realistically argue Aberdeen did not deserve the win. What is unclear is how they did not make it far more comfortable\nIt was a fourth successive defeat for Hamilton, albeit in a very tough run of fixtures. What will be more alarming for manager Martin Canning is the lack of wins in the last two months.\nAt times, the visitors were hanging on by a thread, struggling to contain the attacking threat they faced.\nThey had a fabulous chance for a second shortly before Rooney's goal and that would have made a huge difference.\nShay Logan gave possession away, Rakish Bingham surged clear and found Ali Crawford, but the midfielder could not get enough on his shot to beat Lewis while the goalkeeper was grounded. He should have scored.\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"We passed up so many opportunities. It was one-way traffic in the first half.\n\"By and large I felt we were on the wrong end of a few decisions today and I thought we still managed to thoroughly deserve three points.\n\"Reynolds scores a perfectly valid goal. There was no infringement by Rooney. He was nowhere near the goalkeeper. For me it was a poor decision. We should be up and running with that goal.\n\"We had a penalty kick given against us that's not a penalty. Twice now we've played Hamilton, two poor penalty decisions against us.

At the time, the German empire was a military ally of the Ottomans, and is accused of knowing about the massacres and not doing anything to prevent them. So for many Germans this resolution is about facing up to German historical guilt - something modern Germany is founded upon.\nBut the big question is what this all means for Europe's attempts to solve the migrant crisis.

From its design to its destination, this attack underlines that IS has found a new way to inflict harm and cause terror.\n\"Daesh used, for the first time, a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints,\" a Western security source in Baghdad tells me, using the name for IS more commonly used in the region.\n\"We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying.\"\nPrecise details of the attack, which is under Iraqi investigation, are still being pieced together.\nThe tactic known as a VBIED - vehicle-borne improvised explosive device - is now widely used in suicide bombings.\nBut this one is said to differ in the way the explosives were placed in the van, and how the chemicals were put together.\n\"It's really difficult to make,\" an explosives expert who has knowledge of the investigation explained, saying the device may have been developed in the Iraqi city of Falluja when it was under IS control.\n\"Daesh has given a lot of thought to how to move through checkpoints.\"\nThe bomb-makers are believed to have taken a formula \"available on the internet\", and then adjusted the quantities to reduce its risk of detection, and increase its impact.\nSeveral Iraqi experts also described the mix of chemicals as \"unique\".\n\"We are used to big fires but the chemicals in this bomb were used for the first time in Iraq,\" says Brigadier General Kadhim Bashir Saleh of the Civil Defense Force.\n\"It was unique, strange, and terrible.\"\nAnother Iraqi security expert, Hisham al-Hashimi, told me he believes a similar mix of explosives may have been used, only once, in an attack by al-Qaeda in 2004.\nBut he describes this new tactic deployed by IS as \"very serious and dangerous\".\nThe van exploded on the narrow street just after midnight shortly before Eid Festival when shops were packed with families, football fans were glued to big screens, and the billiard hall was doing brisk business.\nSeveral say the heat created by the first blast was \"as hot as the surface of the sun\".\nThe explosion left no gaping crater, and its impact did not wreck the nearest buildings.\nBut it set off secondary fires which turned out to be the most deadly of all.\nTheir devastating impact was then multiplied by a series of safety failures.\n\"There were no fire escapes,\" laments Sadiq Maroof, a shopkeeper who was one of a small number of people who escaped alive.\nHe takes me through the skeletal remains of the Laith Centre, from the blackened basement where he once ran two popular clothing shops, to the second floor room where he fled for his life.\n\"The stairs behind me were on fire so we pulled a window out of its frame and jumped.\"\n\"There had been two escapes,\" he says, still visibly angry and upset.

In a team with 10-12 nurses you can be responsible for all the patients in a neighbourhood.\"\nThere are no managers and patient satisfaction is the highest for any care organisation in the country. The costs per client are 35% less than the Dutch average. Buurtzorg has also been voted the Netherlands' best employer three years in a row.\n\"Before they introduced me to Buurtzorg, I was with another organisation and that was rubbish,\" said 83-year-old Fred de Smet, from Utrecht.\nHe has been receiving care from Buurtzorg nurses for several years following a stroke, heart problems and leukaemia.\n\"They treat me well, they take care of me. You are a human with them and they don't start saying, we only have X amount of hours or so many minutes to change my support stockings or shower me.\"\nAs well as organising social care, some of the nurses in Amsterdam run a radio show, called Radio Steunkous - which translates to \"radio support stocking\".\n\"Our motto is that everyone can be each other's support stocking,\" said nurse and presenter Ellie Lakerveld.\n\"Our goal is to provide another form of healthcare.

We were responsible for everything. Give trust to the nurses, they have intrinsic motivation.\"\nMr de Blok hopes to encourage other countries to adopt his model.

{"question": "The agent, known by the alias Jack King, infiltrated a group of pro-German activists in south-east England in a previously unknown wartime operation.\nHis undercover work led to the identification of hundreds of people willing to pass secrets to the enemy.\nFiles in the National Archives describe King as a \"genius\" at his work.\nBy Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News\nWe had known that MI5 controlled German spies dropped into the UK under the Double Cross system but little was known about operations to control domestic sympathisers. This one began in a low-key manner with a correspondence club in which lonely people would write to each other but it would lead to the identification of potentially hundreds of people in Britain willing to help the Nazis.\nSince Britain was never invaded, it's impossible to know how the country would have actually reacted, but the files suggest there were at least a few hoping for Hitler to take over and actively offering assistance.\nThe role of the MI5 agent Jack King is also intriguing. Quite who he was seems something of a mystery but senior officials in MI5 clearly rated him highly for his ability over years to undertake risky work in reeling in more and more Nazi sympathisers by convincing them he was linked to the Gestapo - and doing so without ever getting too close to provoking them to do anything too damaging.\nIn 1942, King - also referred to as SR in the files - met Marita Perigoe, described as a \"crafty and dangerous woman\" of Swedish and German origin.\nDespite being married to a member of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, she had no time for the group and regarded them as \"insufficiently extreme\".\nMI5 said of her: \"She was found to be so violently anti-British and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her.\"\nIt went on to say she was not a \"neurotic nor feminine type; she is masterful and a somewhat masculine woman\".\n\"Both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant hun.\"\nKing managed to convince her that he was a representative of the Gestapo looking for people who were \"100% loyal to the Fatherland\" and could be relied on in the event of an invasion.\nHe exploited the group's taste for the cloak-and-dagger aspects of espionage work by offering them invisible ink for secret communications and arranging meetings in the basement of an antiques shop.\nMI5 regarded some members of the group as unstable but warned they were still dangerous.\nHilda Leech was \"unstable and neurotic\" and was trying to pass on reports of highly secret research on jet aircraft, while astrologer Edgar Whitehead  - a \"bit of a mystery man\" - was passing on information about secret trials on an amphibious tank.\nMI5 drew up plans to issue members with special badges to be worn in the event of an invasion - supposedly to identify them as friends to the Germans but in fact to enable them to be swiftly rounded up by the police.\nBy the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents working directly to King - all but one of them British.\nMI5 estimated the number of their contacts who had been the subject of King's intelligence reports ran \"certainly to scores and probably to hundreds\".\nIn other declassified files released by the National Archives, it emerged that English actor Michael Redgrave met Guy Burgess, one of the Cambridge spies, while his theatre group toured Moscow.\nThe meeting in 1958 with his old friend from Cambridge University proved to be of interest to MI5, which was desperate to find out all it could about what was said.\nBurgess, who had fled to Russia seven years earlier, turned up drunk at the theatre where Redgrave was starring in Hamlet.\nBut the two had lunch together the following day at Burgess' flat, provided by the KGB after his defection.\nThe British ambassador at the time said Redgrave had not been very communicative about the meeting and had not consulted the embassy about it beforehand.\nBurgess, however, wrote a letter home to his mother - intercepted by MI5 - delighting in the \"fine gossips\" shared and gushing over Redgrave's acting.\n\"It's certainly the best Hamlet I've ever seen - better than Gielgud, better than Olivier, much better than Paul Schofield.\"", "answer": ["An MI5 agent pretending to have Gestapo links secretly controlled a vast network of UK-based Nazi sympathisers, newly-released files reveal."], "label": "SUM"}

It did add, though, that most trips there are trouble-free.\nAt the end of last month the Maldives celebrated its birthday, 52 years since independence from Britain.\nBut the festivities were marred when the government ordered troops to storm the country's parliament and prevent opposition MPs from entering.\nIt was the latest dramatic attempt by President Abdulla Yameen to maintain his grip on power, and the latest twist in a tale of tropical intrigue worthy of a thriller.\nThe story is certainly set against a suitably exotic backdrop.\nThe Maldives is justifiably famous for its breathtakingly beautiful beaches and breathtakingly expensive luxury hotels.\nBut while the water of the coral reefs that surround them may be crystal clear, politics in the so-called \"island paradise\" has always been very murky indeed.\nThe political drama is centred, not on the beaches but on Male, the tiny, urbanised island where all of the Maldives' major institutions are based and which is one of the most densely populated cities on Earth.\nFor 30 years the country was a corrupt autocracy, ruled with the proverbial \"iron fist\" by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.\nPresident Gayoom shrugged off numerous coup attempts during his three decades in power, but the wily tactician could not resist forever the growing demand for democratic reform.\nIn 2008, a charismatic young progressive, Mohamed Nasheed, swept to power in the country's first democratic elections.\nHe rolled back repressive laws, bolstered democratic institutions and captured the world's attention with an underwater cabinet meeting to highlight the risks of rising sea levels.\nBut the Maldives' brief moment as a model Islamic democracy was not to last.\nLess than four years later, Mr Nasheed resigned following a mutiny by the police and weeks of demonstrations after the arrest of the chief justice, something he now calls a coup.\nIn November 2013, Mr Yameen took office, but as he is Mr Gayoom's half-brother, it looked like a return to the old order.\nHowever, over the last year the two strongmen have had a spectacular falling out.\nSo much so that Mr Gayoom, the grizzled old dictator, has thrown in his lot with the dashing young democrat, Mr Nasheed.\nTo give you an idea of just how improbable this union is, you should know that Mr Nasheed was imprisoned and tortured during Mr Gayoom's rule.\nNevertheless these unlikely allies have prospered and - bolstered by defections from the ruling party - the opposition has managed to gain a small majority in the Maldivian parliament.\nThey had a plan - to stage a coup, but a democratic one.\nThey tabled a no-confidence vote against the speaker of the country's parliament.\nThe idea was to replace him and his deputy with opposition figures, who would lead an emergency government until elections early next year.\nIt looked likely to work, until, that is, Mr Yameen literally called in the troops.\nThey barred opposition MPs from entering parliament for the vote, thereby putting paid to the plotters' plans.\nSince then Mr Yameen has been trying to strip the opposition of its majority, arresting MPs and ruling that defectors must resign their seats.\nIt has been enough to allow him to cling on to power, for the moment at least.\nIf you are wondering why on earth you should care about this sun-soaked soap opera, you need to see the wider picture - because the Maldives is at the centre of a much bigger strategic power play.\nThe country's more than 1,000 islands stretch 800km (500 miles) into the Indian Ocean.\nThey straddle crucial sea-lanes, notably the busy but prosaically named bottleneck, the \"One and a Half Degree Channel\".\nIt makes the Maldives a pawn in the great game for regional influence being played out between India and China, the outcome of which may influence the shape of the world economy for years to come.\nBut there are more basic principles at stake here too - human rights and the rule of democracy.\nAnd they matter just as much in small nations with great beaches like the Maldives, as they do anywhere else in the world.", "answer": ["Are you dreaming of a holiday in the Maldives?"], "label": "SUM"}

The manager who led the Gulls back the Football League, Paul Buckle, former defender Guy Branston, whose last Torquay game was the 2011 League Two play-off final, and life-long supporter Steve Breed give BBC Sport their theories:\nThis season Torquay have had 14 different players join on loan, while three free agents arrived well after the season had begun.\n\"The people you bring to the club are important and they have to know what entails playing for Torquay,\" said Buckle.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I used to say that if I got the right vibe, that they were really on board with this, then I'd go with it, if not I'm not interested.\n\"I wouldn't allow anyone to come to the club unless I was really sure they were right.\"\nAnd Branston believes there are not enough players in the current side with the correct mentality.\n\"It's important that the lads have got to be here for the right reasons,\" he said.\n\"I know a lot of Alan Knill's lads were brought in on good contracts and he brought in a lot of loan players, but I think for a club like Torquay, you've got to make sure you've got the right players. Signing them from the pre-season onwards is big for a club like Torquay.\n\"Plus you've got to be looking to produce your own players that have the right mentality for what the club stands for and what it's all about.\n\"It's having that togetherness as a group, and if you're constantly bringing in loan players it disrupts that core.\"\n\"I didn't think it was significant at the time,\" said Breed.\n\"But in hindsight it clearly was, because we were doing OK up until when Martin went off sick.\n\"With Alan Knill coming in at the back end of that season, he said he saved us, and ultimately he picked the team that kept us in the League, but only in that last game.\n\"I think it was a major problem when Martin went off and maybe not a lot of thought had gone into moving Martin and bringing in Knill at the time.\n\"Martin's said he'd have liked to have come back and perhaps that wouldn't have been a bad idea in hindsight.\"\nBut Branston, who left Torquay in the summer that Ling took over, says the managerial change was justified: \"Unfortunately for Ling he lost his job because the team wasn't winning football matches.\n\"Yes his illness took over and we now know more about it, but they were still losing football matches.\n\"The players shouldn't be affected by what's going on off the pitch, they should deal with it and carry on that mentality that Martin Ling had carried over from Paul Buckle.\"\nTorquay's top scorer is winger Jordan Chappell with five goals, the last of which was scored on 26 October. Joint-second are centre-backs Aaron Downes and Krystian Pearce, with four apiece.\nThe club has used 13 different recognised strikers, either on loan or as permanent signings, with the best return being just three goals.\n\"I think people will quickly say Torquay's biggest problem was not scoring enough goals, but I think you have to look deeper,\" said Branston.\n\"You have to look at the mentality of the players that have been brought in, the ethos of the club.\n\"The team have had a lot of 1-0 defeats, which shows to me that you can't score goals and you can't see out games.\n\"The mentality of a player has to be that if the forwards aren't doing it, then the defenders should be doing it.\"\nBut Breed disagrees and says Knill's decision to sign players like Karl Hawley and loanee Callum Ball just before the start of the season had a big effect.\n\"Our recruitment last summer was poor under Alan Knill, he recruited players on two-year contracts that have done nothing for us.\n\"Hawley and Ball came in a couple of days before the first league game and straight away started the opening game against Wimbledon and just didn't do it for us.\n\"The situation was allowed to continue until we got a forward in like John Marquis, who did OK for us.\n\"But Elliot Benyon simply hasn't scored enough goals and they have had the chances, they have had the supply line.\"\n\"It is difficult, but it'll be made easier that Luton are out of it now,\" says Buckle, who as well as guiding Torquay to promotion from the Conference, also managed Luton last season.\n\"You don't want too many clubs in there on big money who are trying to buy their way out, so to speak.\n\"But I don't think it's as strong as it has been and I'm hopeful that they can recreate what we did and get back.\n\"Torquay are a Football League club, we've proved that, but we've got to get the right people in. Chris Hargreaves knows that.\"\nBranston feels it is important that the club can get rid of the players who do not want to be at the club, and bring in experienced winners.\n\"You have to change quickly. As soon as the pre-season starts you wipe the slate clean, you get out the core element of the problem, whatever that may be.\n\"You bring people in who've won the Conference and played in the Conference who have the right mentality to take clubs forward and you breed players off that.\n\"You produce you own players who have got the ethos of Torquay United in their veins from when they're 15, 16 or 17 years-old. Where are those players? Why haven't we seen those players for three or four years?\"\nBut Breed is not so sure: \"When we went down last time, that summer we recruited Paul Buckle, we had a new manager, we had almost a complete new team and we had a new board of directors.\n\"There was a real feel-good factor, we played Grays Athletic in our first home game and there were 4,500 people here and everything seemed really new.\n\"Now we're going down again and the manager we've got here I feel is struggling very badly, there's no new board of directors and finances are an issue.\n\"You lose a lot of money coming down.\n\"I'll be very surprised if Torquay ever become a League club again.

{"question": "King Salman's decree also means Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, will become deputy prime minister while continuing as defence minister.\nPrince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, has been removed from his role as head of domestic security, state media say.\nHe has pledged allegiance to the new crown prince, his younger cousin.\nSaudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s.\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman's rapid ascent is seen by the younger generation as a sign that things are changing.\nBefore his latest promotion, he was responsible for leading Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, overseeing the kingdom's energy policy and economic reform.\nHe must have already ruffled a lot of feathers in a royal family that was used to being presided over by a succession of elderly men, the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports.\nHis father King Salman is 81 and reportedly not in the best of health, our correspondent adds.\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman could, potentially, lead Saudi Arabia for decades, heralding a long period of internal stability.\nHowever, the new crown prince is close to US President Donald Trump, and could ratchet up pressure against Iran - which would raise tensions in the region.\nThe rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been meteoric.\nWhen I met him in Jeddah in 2013 he described himself as simply \"a lawyer\". Today he is a heartbeat away from ruling the most powerful country in the Arab world.\nDespite being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's damaging and inconclusive military campaign in Yemen, he is largely popular at home, especially with younger Saudis.\nHe has swept away many of the ineffective timeservers in government offices and replaced them with young, Western-educated technocrats. He has set out a possibly over-ambitious development plan, \"Vision 2030\", and announced plans to sell off part of the vast state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco.\nHe has also forged ties with Washington and the Trump administration.\nBut his biggest and most risky move may yet prove to be his bid to curb the power of the conservative religious establishment. Washington likes this move, but others closer to home do not.\nThe founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud), had dozens of sons, and there are as many as 15,000 princes and princesses in the royal family.\nIn 2006, a decree was passed setting up a committee responsible for electing the king and crown prince. The committee is made up of senior princes of the Al Saud royal family and is known as the Allegiance Council.\nMohammed bin Salman's new promotion to crown prince was approved by 31 out of 34 members of the council.\nAnalysts say those in power tend to appoint their sons to roles that will enhance their chances of being promoted - so when monarchs and crown princes change, sons can come into and out of favour.\nKing Salman, a son of King Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the death of his half-brother Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz.\nHe launched his first major cabinet reshuffle a few months later, promoting Mohammed bin Nayef to crown prince and Mohammed bin Salman, who was relatively unknown at that time, to deputy crown prince.\nExperts say the second reshuffle has reduced uncertainty over the line of succession, and means the king has averted a potential power struggle between his son and his nephew.\nThe decree promoting Mohammed bin Salman includes a clause preventing him from appointing one of his own sons as his heir.\nIt is the most influential Arab country - and a key ally of Western powers including the US and the UK.\nThe kingdom is also the world's second largest oil producer - and the Saudi royal family is thought to be one of the richest ruling families in the world.\nIt is guardian of the two most holy sites in Islam, and regards itself as leader of the Sunni community worldwide.\nThe kingdom is a key player in Sunni attempts to block Shia Iranian influence in the Middle East.\nIt has launched air strikes on Yemen to fight Houthi rebels, who Saudi Arabia believes are backed by Iran. However, the campaign has been criticised for human rights violations - including the killing many civilians.\nRecently, Saudi Arabia also joined efforts to impose a blockade on Qatar.\nPrince Mohammed bin Nayef was the kingdom's security chief for many years and was known for his strong stance against jihadist militants.\nAs deputy prime minister and interior minister, he headed up the counter-terrorism portfolio, and also had good relations with Saudi Arabia's Western allies.\nState media broadcast footage showing Mohammed bin Nayef meeting Mohammed bin Salman after the succession was announced.\nThe former crown prince said \"I am content\" and \"I am going to rest now. May God help you\", while the new heir replied \"May God help you. I will never do without your advice\".\nReaction to the appointment of the new crown prince was largely (and unsurprisingly) celebratory, although Saudi Arabia's regional rivals took the opportunity to criticise the kingdom.\nSaudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV ran blanket coverage and emphasised the positive effect the appointment had on the country's stock exchange.  Similar reports appeared in other friendly Arab states.\nBut in Iran - Saudi Arabia's bitter rival - several news outlets described the appointment as a \"soft coup\".\nSimilar language was used by the Pro-Qatari HuffPost Arabi, which called the appointment \"a coup in the royal palace\".\nSyrian state media's largely neutral report came with a considerable sting in the tail.\nCoverage ended with a reminder to viewers of a \"tyrannical regime\" which \"lacks the most basic democratic principles\" and \"supports terrorism\".\nJihadists on social media celebrated the reshuffle, anticipating that the changes would pave the way for internal strife within the House of Saud and eventually bring about its downfall.", "answer": ["Saudi Arabia's king has appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince - replacing his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, as first in line to the throne."], "label": "SUM"}

Previously, some people had to pay several thousand pounds towards repairs.\nHowever, houses built since 2009 will not be covered by the scheme. This was done to discourage developers from building on land at risk of flooding.\nBusinesses are also excluded, as are landlords who take out insurance policies on homes they do not occupy themselves.\nThe scheme has also been criticised by a group of climate change experts, who said it did not offer good value for money.\n\"It achieves very poor value for money because it is trying to subsidise the costs of flooding, rather than addressing the causes and trying to prevent flooding in the first place,\" said Daniel Johns, head of adaptation on the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nInitially 17 insurance companies are taking part in the scheme.
