{"passage": "__Have you ever wondered?____Why do airplanes take longer to fly west than east?__It can take five hours to go west-east from New York (NY) to London but seven hours to travel east-west from London to NY. The reason for the difference is an atmospheric phenomenon known as the jet（喷射）stream. The jet stream is a very high altitude wind which always blows from the west to the east across the Atlantic.
