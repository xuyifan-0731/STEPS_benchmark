{"question": "Ben Mee is more concerned with the impact Burnley’s win could have on their bid for Premier League survival than the blow it has dealt to his old club Manchester City. Sale-born Mee captained City to victory in the FA Youth Cup in 2008, just four months before the Abu Dhabi takeover, but was one of a number of youngsters who realised their futures lay elsewhere. Having achieved his Premier League ambitions with Burnley, the 25-year-old left back is desperate to keep them there over the final nine games of the season after a surprise win over the champions. Ben Mee says Burnley deserves a stroke of luck after this tackle was deemed OK by referee Andre Marriner . City right back Pablo Zabaleta clearly disagreed as the penalty should was waved away in his side's 1-0 loss . Mee, with Burnley keeper Tom Heaton, says the win was 'definitely a statement' for his side . ‘We’re still in it as we always have been, but this is definitely a statement,’ said Mee. ‘Teams will be a bit shocked we’ve managed to get three points. City have got a lot to do now. 'I had a couple of mates in the City end and I’m driving two of them home so I’ll enjoy that.’ Mee was relieved that referee Andre Marriner didn’t award a penalty for his challenge on Pablo Zabaleta late in the game. He added: ‘You always worry the referee has seen it from an angle and will give it, but we deserve a bit of luck.’ The left back attempts to console City's Sergio Aguero after the match which ended in a massive upset .

{"question": "An Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death testified Wednesday that she would 'rather die' than hurt the little girl, and denied making her run as punishment. Joyce Hardin Garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. When defense attorney Richard Rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt Savannah or any other grandchildren, Garrard replied, 'I'd rather die first.' The 49-year-old Garrard said she and Savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking, taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play. She said she was telling Savannah the importance of not lying. Took the stand: Joyce Garrard, 49, took the stand in her own defense Wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10-year-old granddaughter Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy . 'I was picking up sticks with her because I felt just as responsible for her lying as she was,' Garrard testified. Prosecutors say Garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy. 'It was 'more like a jog and not a run,' Garrard maintained. Garrard said Savannah was such an active child, the only way to hold her attention was to keep her moving. 'We was hooting and hollering, fussing back and forth,' Garrard said. Garrard said they picked up sticks for about 40 minutes, but spent much of the day in the yard. She said Savannah told her she had to go to the bathroom and they were racing into the house when the girl fell backward. Garrard said that's when she told Savannah's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, to call 911. 'Did you have some intent to hurt Savannah?' Rhea asked. 'Not that day or any other day,' Garrard replied. Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), 9, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right) One word on a 911 recording could help decide Garrard's fate. With 9-year-old Savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone, Joyce Hardin Garrard asked for something — either a cigarette or a blanket. The request, depending on exactly what she said, could be considered callousness or compassion. On the Feb. 17, 2012, recording, played in court Tuesday, Garrard is heard in the background as the girl's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, talked for more than 11 minutes with Lori Beth Beggs, a 911 operator in Etowah County. 'My daughter had a seizure,' Hardin says at the beginning. Speaking in a loud voice as Hardin talks to Beggs, Garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child's name and asking her to wake up. 'Savannah. Savannah,' Garrard says in a steady voice. 'Savannah, open your eyes.' Then, nearly three minutes into the recording, with Savannah still unresponsive, Garrard makes a request. 'Give me a smoke,' Beggs testified the woman said. The defense maintains she said: 'Give me a throw,' referring to a small blanket. While jurors have listened to the recording, Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree refused to let them see a transcript of the audio prepared for the defense. What the jurors believe she said could be vital. If Garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying, jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours. If they believe the woman said 'throw,' jurors could see that as sign Garrard was worried and trying to help the girl. Other testimony showed that the girl was wrapped in a small blanket when firefighters and paramedics arrived. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death wasn't Gerrard's fault . Prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine Garrard later Wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney. Garrard faces a death sentence or life without parole if convicted of capital murder. The girl's stepmother is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped. A defense expert said in dramatic testimony Tuesday that he wouldn't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death, yet he agreed the child wouldn't have died without exhausting physical exertion. Questioned by an attorney for Garrard at her capital murder trial, forensic pathologist Dr. James Lauridson indicated he couldn't say someone else caused the death of Savannah Hardin, 9. 'Knowing what I know I would not have called this a homicide, I would have called it indeterminate,' said Lauridson, retired chief medical examiner for Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Lauridson — using water, dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency — said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started seizing. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Jurors paid close attention to Lauridson, standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony. Garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter's death wasn't a homicide. But under cross-examination by prosecutor Marcus Reid, Lauridson admitted he didn't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to Dr. Emily Ward, the state pathologist who ruled that the girl's death was a homicide. Her decision was crucial to the decision to charge Garrard. Neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old Boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop, and Reid drove home the point to jurors. 'It was running that killed her. Isn't that right?' Reid asked Lauridson. 'Yes,' Lauridson replied. Lauridson's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator Chris Crow, who helped Ward with the post-mortem investigation of Savannah's death. Crow testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy. The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said. Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as 'pretty quick' for such an examination. But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed, and Ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garrard, who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012. Garrard, of Boaz, says she is innocent. Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state. Defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death .", "answer": ["Joyce Garrard, 49, is charged with killing 10-year-old Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy .\nGarrard took the witness stand Wednesday to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin .\nGarrard's lawyers haven't denied that the girl ran before her collapse, but the defense said the woman had no intention of harming her granddaughter ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "New Zealand reached their first ever World Cup final as they secured a sensational four-wicket Duckworth/Lewis win over South Africa at a sold out Eden Park on Tuesday. An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory.

The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand’s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of ‘chokers’ and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand’s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps’ fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla’s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side’s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw’s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier’s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier’s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa’s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34.

Duminy (left) celebrates with Du Plessis as South Africa appeared to take control of the contest . Taylor was caught behind for 30, as New Zealand struggled to keep up with the rate . It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel’s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland .

{"question": "(CNN)Newly released al Qaeda documents, including letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year or so before his May 2011 death, show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the CIA drone program that was killing many of the group's leaders in Pakistan's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. As a result of this pressure, al Qaeda officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as Afghanistan or Iran. They also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Pakistani government had any clue about bin Laden's location or presence in Pakistan. CIA efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in June 2010 an al Qaeda official urged bin Laden, \"You should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period. Make the period between contacts longer and further apart. Take excessive caution and care, especially this year.\" This was wise counsel. Within a few weeks of this letter being written, the CIA would track bin Laden's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 1, 2011, a U.S. Navy SEAL operation ordered by President Barack Obama killed al Qaeda's leader. The new al Qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the SEALs recovered at bin Laden's compound. Several were released during the Brooklyn trial last month of al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer. Seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of bin Laden's death. It's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world, just as ISIS does today. The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden. The documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al Qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against Western targets. In a report on \"external operations,\" an al Qaeda official explained that a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Russia had fizzled and that despite sending al Qaeda members to the UK to hit \"several targets\" these operations had also come to nothing. Al Qaeda had also sent \"three brothers\" on a terrorist mission to Denmark, a country that bin Laden loathed because of the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but had \"lost contact with them.\" Given all the problems the group was having, an al Qaeda strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the \"simplest things such as  household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as  killing tools.\" 2011: U.S. offers details about bin Laden raid . A major theme of the documents is how much punishment the CIA drone program was inflicting on al Qaeda. Al Qaeda officials considered moving to Nuristan, a remote mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, or to other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh or Balochistan and even to Iran, which had been a key sanctuary for a number of al Qaeda's leaders after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. Al Qaeda mulled opening an office in Iran, but \"we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations.\" In a letter to bin Laden, an al Qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of Mustafa Yazid, then the No. 3 leader of the group, on the night of May 22, 2010. The al Qaeda official wrote that Yazid was staying at the house of a \"well-known\" supporter of al Qaeda when a drone started making \"distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced. They all know that if a plane starts doing these turns, it is going to strike.\" Yazid and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike, according to the official. The official lamented that drones are \"still circling our skies every day\" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover. The official wrote but \"then they come back when the sky is clear.\" Al Qaeda had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones \"but no result so far,\" according to the al Qaeda official. Underlining al Qaeda's weakness, during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the Pakistani government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al Qaeda's battle was \"primarily against the Americans. You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone.\" Highlights of bin Laden documents released in 2012 . The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis. At one point an al Qaeda official referred to \"bin Laden's call to jihad against the apostate government of Pakistan.\" Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda. According to the documents, Pakistani intelligence officials \"reached out to\" al Qaeda through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the Haqqani Taliban faction that have contacts with the ISI. The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive. Bergen in 2013: Bin Laden's life on the run . Moreover during the course of reporting the book \"Manhunt,\" about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad. The documents did show one area of real success for al Qaeda, which was kidnapping for ransom, a tactic ISIS has been using so effectively. In 2008, al Qaeda had captured Afghanistan's former ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Khaliq Farahi. After two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $5 million. An al Qaeda official told bin Laden that some of this money would be a \"gift\" to him \"from all the brothers.\" Bin Laden cautioned al Qaeda's leaders to be careful with the ransom money, as it might have to last the terrorist group several years. The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations. 2011: How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . Far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed, the documents portray bin Laden as a hands-on manager of al Qaeda. In a 10-page letter that bin Laden wrote in August 2010, he had reams of advice for the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, ordering that the group not attack Sufi Muslims in Somalia and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the President of neighboring Uganda who had sent his troops to fight Al-Shabaab. Bin Laden gave detailed notes about how Al-Shabaab could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation, and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from Indonesia. He also advised Al-Shabaab against cutting down too many trees because it is \"dangerous for the environment of the region.\" Bin Laden had lived in nearby Sudan in the mid-'90s, establishing a number of business and farming enterprises. Bin Laden, something of a micromanager, told his top lieutenant to \"send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions.\" He also cautioned against sending any emails, including even encrypted ones, urging that hand-delivered letters were the only safe method of communication. Bergen on 2012 documents: Seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager . Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand \"the enemy's policies in the region.\" And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past, so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Bin Laden said he didn't want Zaidan to interview any members of his family, but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter \"promptly\" to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer. Bin Laden was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As the new al Qaeda documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the West was just that: a dream. And the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the CIA drone program.

Like the rodent he keeps as a pet, Pavel has grown accustomed to a subterranean existence after nine months living in a basement where he eats, sleeps and plays. Accompanied by his family and a group of others who have seen their city descend into a war zone, the young boy takes refuge from the ever-present threat of stray bullets and artillery fire. Waiting for lunch: Pavel Makeev, age 5, peeks his head through a doorway while waiting for his lunch to be cooked in Donetsk, Ukraine . Pavel and his family live in the basement of the cultural centre in Petrovskiy, an area of Donetsk  under pro-Russian rebel control, and the city above him has seen months of heavy and terrifying clashes between Ukrainian troops and rebels. Since the February 15 ceasefire, fighting may have eased but it has  not stopped altogether. The thump of artillery fire and the rattle of automatic guns still echo through a bleak landscape of fallen trees and splintered houses. Going home is still not a safe option. Life in the basement is simple, but with working electricity, the family have light and are able to use stoves to cook. A shabby collection of furniture and materials salvaged from buildings above decorates their underground home. Much of the natural light that the few windows allow in is blocked by protective sandbags. The desperate family are just a few of the thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - which began in April 2014 after Kiev sent its military to the southeastern regions that refused to recognize the new authorities in the capital.

{"question": "(CNN)She married a man whose first wife mysteriously disappeared. And she stood by him even after he admitted killing a neighbor and chopping up the body. But who is Debrah Lee Charatan, the wife of millionaire heir Robert Durst? And what role has she played in his life? Charatan hasn't spoken publicly since her husband's arrest in New Orleans over the weekend, and CNN was unable to reach her for comment. In \"The Jinx,\" the HBO documentary about Durst's life, she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago. The series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between Durst and Charatan. Charatan says she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing. The two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before Durst's longtime friend Susan Berman turned up dead in Beverly Hills, California. This week, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged Durst with first-degree murder in that case. It's an accusation he has long denied. He also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife's disappearance. In a 2003 trial, he admitted he'd shot a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, and dismembered the body, but was acquitted of murder after arguing he'd acted in self defense. Recorded jailhouse calls from Durst's imprisonment during that case suggest that Charatan was his rock. \"Am I supposed to be smiling or am I supposed to be grim?\" Durst asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial. Charatan quickly replies, \"I would just have as close to no expression, yeah, that's what I think.\" She was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney Michael Kennedy, a lawyer Durst's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case. The insanity defense Kennedy was planning to use, she said at the time, could have meant both Durst and Charatan were cut out of the family fortune. \"What he doesn't want is me to get any of the trust money later on, since I'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time, OK, that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions,\" she says in another call. Like Durst himself, Charatan is a powerful player on the New York real estate scene. \"She's not some opportunistic woman who came into Bob's life for monetary gain. She was very successful, a millionaire several times over long before she met Bob,\" said Amir Korangy, publisher of TheRealDeal.com. Susan Criss, the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial, said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it's clear that Charatan is motivated by financial gain. \"It's very clear that she only cares about the money,\" Criss said. Some former friends and employees described Charatan in less than glowing terms. Former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions. According to sources, she only briefly lived with Durst and they are now separated, though still married. Why doesn't the HBO documentary feature any more recent interviews with her? Charatan didn't want Durst to participate in \"The Jinx,\" Korangy said, and she hasn't spoken with him since it started airing. CNN's Catherine E.

{"question": "Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. will be released from a federal prison on Thursday and will serve out the remainder of his term in a Washington, D.C., halfway house, former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy told The Associated Press after visiting Jackson behind bars. Kennedy said he spoke with Jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 ½-year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items. The expenditures included fur capes, lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before Election Day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of federal crimes in a scheme that involved spending mroe than $750,000 of his campaign money on more than 3,000 personal items . BIG HOUSE: Jackson sered his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina – the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 and were present for their son's sentencing . Jackson began the sentence on Nov. 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as Sept. 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods – including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, \"I'm leaving Thursday morning\",' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. SUMPTUOUS: Jackson's Washington, DC house got a decorator's touch, courtesy of his campaign donors . Among the items auctioned by the US Marshals Service was this framed and autographed cymbal from Michael Jackson's last concert tour . Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.", "answer": ["Former congressman pleaded guilty in 2013 to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife – buying more than 3,000 items .\nSentenced to 30 months but will move to a halfway house tomorrow after serving barely half of that behind bars .\nAnother former Democratic congressman visited him in prison and learned about the impending move .\nJackson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before his downward spiral .\nHis father is the civil rights activist and preacher Rev.

{"question": "The former ACT chief minister has revealed a long-term, exhausting battle with anorexia, which saw her weight dwindle to a mere 30 kilograms. The 59-year-old has announced her teenage struggles at a function on Monday and has shared that she still has to have little discussions with herself about body image and naturally thinks she is too fat. Now the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Carnell has recalled beginning to lose weight at 12 or 13 years old when a teenage interest in boys and fashion sparked. The head of the Australia Chamber of Commerce announced her continuing struggles at a function on Monday . She said she felt rotten about herself and what she was doing to others in her life. 'I was stick thin but people said 'wow you are looking so great.' I wasn't - I was looking really skinny,' she told ABC television. 'It is hard to understand why you can't put a piece of food in your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. How hard can that be. When you've got anorexia it's like moving a mountain,' she said. The ABC reported that Ms Carnell was in and out of hospitals in her home town of Brisbane during the 1960s and 70s and was lying to her parents about what she was eating and the amount of exercise she was doing. The battle with anorexia began when she was 12 or 13 and she gained an interest in boys and fashion . Her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms and saw her in and out of hospitals . When 15-years-old, she was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney when the situation became severe. 'For a 15-year-old away from home it was to say the least pretty scary,' she said. She said her parents were only allowed to visit occasionally and she was incredibly homesick. 'Imagine a scenario when you've got a teenage daughter who's always been a bit of an overachiever, pretty smart — and all of a sudden they're killing themselves in front of your eyes,' she said. Ms. Carnell outlined these experiences at a function where the advocacy group The Butterfly Foundation released a report that outlined the high cost of treating eating disorders that affected almost a million Australians. The chairman of the Butterfly Foundation, David Murray said their report from Deloitte focuses on the economic cost of the problem and the large benefits of intervention. 'Early intervention pays big time, with about a 50 per cent cost reduction for the government in the health system by getting the problem early enough,' he said. 'We have to adjust the system for early intervention which very quickly recognises this as a mental condition and brings in the right type of specialist support.'", "answer": ["The head of the ACCI outlined her struggles at a function on Monday .\nThrough her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms .\nAt 15 years old she was sent to a psychiatric facility in Sydney .\nChairman of The Butterfly Foundation has said intervention pays big time ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Some of us are not obvious cruisers. I have an irrational fear of death by drowning and can't bear the thought of eating three meals a day, every day. So the prospect of a 16-day voyage round New Zealand to Australia is alarming. Will I survive? Or will I disappear overboard, laden with food, the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster? New Zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains, fjords, forests, glaciers, and lakes, home to the dolphin, whale, penguin, albatross, seal and sea-lion (there is a difference: the latter eat the former for breakfast). A place to pause: The tiny port of Picton is a gateway to the winelands of New Zealand's Marborough region . Home, too, to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson-flowered pohutukawa, the New Zealand Christmas tree. And you can get oysters everywhere. It's a long journey to New Zealand, so make sure you find somewhere to recover. The Boatshed on Waiheke Island, a short ferry ride from Auckland, is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land. I'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a Harley Davidson - 1800cc of shiny, macho metal. 'Have you ridden an HD before?' asks my hunky 'chauffeur'. No, but I used to have a Lambretta 125. Coming back for more: A high percentage of people on the Seabourn Odyssey are returning passengers . 'Just lean when I lean,' he says. I cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed. My cruising worries begin to evaporate when I meet the crew of Seabourn Odyssey. 'Welcome home,' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words, until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees. In our ship-shape suite, everything is sparklingly clean (as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps, I notice these things). Captain Cook charted the coastline of New Zealand 245 years ago. As well as unpredictable seas, he feared scurvy, caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which leads to suppurating wounds, loss of teeth and ultimately death. No danger of that on the Odyssey. I can't think of another period in my life when I've eaten so well, so consistently. Cook pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut; I sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canapé. That night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep. Taken for a ride: Sue took a tour of Waiheke island in speedy two-wheeled style - on a Harley Davidson . The ship has 450 passengers, 11 decks, four restaurants, a spa, fitness centre, swimming pool, hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than Cook's ship. On day one, we disembark andhead for Rotorua and its strange geothermal pools. 'Tours4Matures' says a minibus sign — a reminder of the age profile. We hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud, hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters. But why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap can't reach? We get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing. Independence comes at a price. Crossing the Cook Strait to South Island, we anchor at the tiny port of Picton and take an excursion into the Marlborough High Country, to a remote sheep station where we meet Hailey Pitts. She and her husband Jeremy farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep. It's a hard life, but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it. As we cruise through Queen Charlotte Sound, said to be Captain Cook's favourite anchorage, peace envelops me. I sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us. What a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station. Idyllic: Waiheke island sits on Auckland's doorstep - but feels far removed from New Zealand's biggest city . Ah, well - what's for dinner? In Akaroa, we see Hector's dolphin, the smallest and rarest in the world. In Port Chalmers, we climb up to a memorial to Captain Robert Scott. He set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the South Pole. The sunset is spectacular that night and I think of Captain Scott and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears, leaving behind a trail of light, first pink, then orange, then burgundy, until finally blackness falls. (Trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite. Let's just say it was moving.) On south, until we hit the last land before the South Pole, the beautiful Stewart Island. Due west - nothing but sea until the tip of South America. Due east - ditto. It's time to turn and head out to Australia. It's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of New Zealand across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne. Gale force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves. My irrational fears return. The crossing takes three long days and nights, But I come to realise how a big ship like the Odyssey can cope with such seas. I relax into the camaraderie that develops on board, and at long last we're cruising into Melbourne and then along the coast to Sydney. Calm comforts: Picton is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the Cook Strait . At 6am on a beautiful summer's morning, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge welcome us to a city full of promise. That afternoon, I watch from my hotel window as the Seabourn Odyssey sets sail once more, back to Auckland. Now someone else is in suite 722. Someone else is being made to feel this is a voyage designed only for them. I confess to feeling proprietorial and not a little emotional. I must be a cruiser.

{"question": "(CNN)Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. \"In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. \"While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\"", "answer": ["A new study shows a 43% lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco-vegetarian diet .\nColorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the U.S.\nPlant-based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £1,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around £10,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least £6,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put £743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to £120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of £383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that £383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' £272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and £208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just £61.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged £896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some £4,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The £896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly £5,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

{"question": "Chile's president went to a hospital Saturday to meet with a 14-year-old girl who shocked the country by going on YouTube to plead for the leader to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis. The government quickly said no after the video began spreading on social media Thursday. A government statement said President Michelle Bachelet talked with Valentina Maureira and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in the capital. Scroll down for video . President Michelle Bachelet, right, poses for a selfie with Valentina Maureira, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, at a hospital in Santiago, Chile . Officials did not release any information on what was said. But the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Valentina taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Maureira, a 14-year girl who suffers cystic fibrosis and asked the Government for permission to die through a YouTube video, at the Clinic Hospital of Catholic University of Santiago de Chile . Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia. 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said. Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said. Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old . Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.' 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life. 'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said.

{"question": "Host commentator . That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid £90million for Bale or £65m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it. Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters. They definitely won’t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad. Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata. I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game – that is something that is always missing from a Clasico. Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I’ve seen him recently. Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball. He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night. He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo’s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn’t see a great deal of the ball. He certainly didn’t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself. Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he’d played some part in – no Barcelona player has played in more. What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Barça vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He’ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it. Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying. So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don’t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you’ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome. Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest. He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch. You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though. I don’t think he’s very happy for several reasons. Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club’s supporters – he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called ‘fans’ have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning). He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year. CLICK HERE to read the full story as angry Madrid fan attacks Bale's car . Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid. Paul Clement would I’m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal – who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League – would have a coach who has won the competition three times. It all sounds perfect, I don’t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion! Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn’t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca. We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool don’t exactly play like Harry Basset’s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him. It’s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him. Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season. The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader’s performance. Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard. It’s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn’t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning ‘La Decima’ but he hasn’t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change. Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge. Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward. Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3. He put a decent shift in but if he’s working back he can’t also be on Jordi Alba’s shoulder waiting to pull away. This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities. He also faded last night because the team did – Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered. Pete Jenson: It’s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives. But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too. So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game. Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool. In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal. At Barcelona he’s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind. I’m not sure he’ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season – but he will score more important ones.

{"question": "(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice.

{"question": "Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators £3,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'", "answer": ["Teacher Kim Davies made more than 20 complaints against a colleague .\nShe lodged a further nine complaints with an exam board .\nMs Davies faced a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct .\nThe teacher was followed by private detectives after taking sick leave .\nCaerphilly Council thought Ms Davies was trying to defraud the system .\nMs Davies was reprimanded by a watchdog for breaking a number of rules .\nShe was also criticised for making several vexatious complaints .\nMs Davies avoided a classroom ban following the watchdog's hearing .\nShe said she now wanted to get back into the classroom and teach ."], "label": "SUM"}
