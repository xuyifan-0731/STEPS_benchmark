The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961.\nBy 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute.\nHe went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941.\nBy the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy.\nHaving bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators.\nHe also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking.\nThe Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack.\nStigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy.\nBut he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd.\n\"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.

{"question": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nAccies survived some nervous moments before Ash Taylor headed the Dons ahead after 34 minutes.\nBut the lead only lasted four minutes as Dougie Imrie scored from the penalty spot after Danny Redmond was challenged by goalkeeper Joe Lewis.\nRooney pounced when Gary Woods parried a James Maddison shot, before Accies' Scott McMann was shown a late red card.\nThe win - thanks to the Irish striker's 11th goal this season - takes Aberdeen to within four points of second-placed Rangers in the Scottish Premiership table.\nAccies remain second bottom without a victory in 10 games since beating the Dons in October.\nAberdeen were fluid and dangerous from the off, exposing Accies' weakness on the left flank, with Louis Longridge inexperienced in a full-back role against Jonny Hayes.\nMark Reynolds netted early on, but referee Andrew Dallas saw pushing and ruled it out, perhaps a touch harshly as the Dons defender didn't appear to be the culprit.\nIt seemed only a matter of time for the home side, with visiting defenders struggling to cope with the recurring threat.\nOne corner in particular caused chaos involving a Reynolds header that was saved, an overhead kick clearance and a follow up effort from Andrew Considine with the ball eventually forced behind.\nChances and corners flowed. Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.\nThe breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.\nIncredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.\nTaylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.\nThe goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.\nAberdeen responded well to that set-back, with Woods superbly tipping Taylor's drive over before Rooney appeared to be pushed in the box, but pleas were ignored.\nThe Dons went forward relentlessly. Manager Derek McInnes made a positive move, bringing on Maddison for Considine and it proved decisive.\nIt was Maddison's shot that Woods palmed back into play perfectly for the onrushing Rooney to net.\nMcMann prevented a third, hauling Hayes to the ground just outside the box that earned a red card with the winger in on goal.\nNo-one could realistically argue Aberdeen did not deserve the win. What is unclear is how they did not make it far more comfortable\nIt was a fourth successive defeat for Hamilton, albeit in a very tough run of fixtures. What will be more alarming for manager Martin Canning is the lack of wins in the last two months.\nAt times, the visitors were hanging on by a thread, struggling to contain the attacking threat they faced.\nThey had a fabulous chance for a second shortly before Rooney's goal and that would have made a huge difference.\nShay Logan gave possession away, Rakish Bingham surged clear and found Ali Crawford, but the midfielder could not get enough on his shot to beat Lewis while the goalkeeper was grounded. He should have scored.\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"We passed up so many opportunities. It was one-way traffic in the first half.\n\"By and large I felt we were on the wrong end of a few decisions today and I thought we still managed to thoroughly deserve three points.\n\"Reynolds scores a perfectly valid goal. There was no infringement by Rooney. He was nowhere near the goalkeeper. For me it was a poor decision. We should be up and running with that goal.\n\"We had a penalty kick given against us that's not a penalty. Twice now we've played Hamilton, two poor penalty decisions against us. Thankfully today it didn't cost us.\"\nHamilton manager Martin Canning: \"I think the game turns on a big moment.

It also says Germany - at the time an ally of the Ottomans - bears some guilt for doing nothing to stop the killings.\nThe reactions from Ankara are every bit as strong as feared. Turkey's foreign minister even accused Berlin of trying to deflect from the dark episodes of its own history, a clear reference to Germany's Nazi past.\nBut for many German politicians this vote was about exactly the opposite: it was about dealing with not just Turkey's difficult 20th century history, but also Germany's.\nMany of the speeches in parliament focused on German responsibility in the 1915 killings. At the time, the German empire was a military ally of the Ottomans, and is accused of knowing about the massacres and not doing anything to prevent them. So for many Germans this resolution is about facing up to German historical guilt - something modern Germany is founded upon.\nBut the big question is what this all means for Europe's attempts to solve the migrant crisis. Diplomatic relations may be strained. But the hope in Berlin is that tensions don't scupper the EU's new refugee deal with Turkey.\nUnder a deal struck in March, Turkey agreed to take back migrants - including Syrians - arriving on Greek islands, in return for EU aid and a pledge to give Turks visa-free travel to most of Europe.\nGermany accepted 1.1 million migrants last year - by far the highest influx in the EU.\nGerman-Turkish relations were also strained this year by the case of comedian Jan Boehmermann, whose obscene poem about Mr Erdogan prompted a criminal complaint from the Turkish leader.\nLast month a court in Hamburg ruled that Boehmermann's poem was satire, but banned him from repeating the sexual references in it, deeming them unacceptable.\nGermany plans to repeal a clause in the constitution prohibiting insults that target foreign leaders - the clause invoked by Turkey in the complaint.\nFind out more about what happened\nArmenian tragedy still raw in Turkey", "answer": ["The German parliament has approved a resolution declaring that the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One was a \"genocide\"."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Sweepers start to clear away debris, and drills buzz in the shells of gutted shops.\nBut the scene of the deadliest ever attack carried out by so-called Islamic State (IS) anywhere in the world is still a makeshift shrine. On 3 July, 292 Iraqis lost their lives here.\nThis week, the haunting strains of a cello wafted through the cavernous black hulks where two popular centres once drew in Iraqis for shopping and socialising.\n\"If terrorists are trying to turn every element of life into a battlefield, I will turn it into a field of beauty and civilisation,\" declares Karim Wasifi, composer and conductor with Iraq's National Symphony Orchestra.\nHe has played his cello at other major bomb sites in Baghdad as an affirmation of Iraqis' determination to fight back.\nHardly a day goes by without an attack somewhere in a city laced with security checkpoints and armed guards.\nBut the explosion in Baghdad's Karrada neighbourhood was no ordinary bomb. From its design to its destination, this attack underlines that IS has found a new way to inflict harm and cause terror.\n\"Daesh used, for the first time, a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints,\" a Western security source in Baghdad tells me, using the name for IS more commonly used in the region.\n\"We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying.\"\nPrecise details of the attack, which is under Iraqi investigation, are still being pieced together.\nThe tactic known as a VBIED - vehicle-borne improvised explosive device - is now widely used in suicide bombings.\nBut this one is said to differ in the way the explosives were placed in the van, and how the chemicals were put together.\n\"It's really difficult to make,\" an explosives expert who has knowledge of the investigation explained, saying the device may have been developed in the Iraqi city of Falluja when it was under IS control.\n\"Daesh has given a lot of thought to how to move through checkpoints.\"\nThe bomb-makers are believed to have taken a formula \"available on the internet\", and then adjusted the quantities to reduce its risk of detection, and increase its impact.\nSeveral Iraqi experts also described the mix of chemicals as \"unique\".\n\"We are used to big fires but the chemicals in this bomb were used for the first time in Iraq,\" says Brigadier General Kadhim Bashir Saleh of the Civil Defense Force.\n\"It was unique, strange, and terrible.\"\nAnother Iraqi security expert, Hisham al-Hashimi, told me he believes a similar mix of explosives may have been used, only once, in an attack by al-Qaeda in 2004.\nBut he describes this new tactic deployed by IS as \"very serious and dangerous\".\nThe van exploded on the narrow street just after midnight shortly before Eid Festival when shops were packed with families, football fans were glued to big screens, and the billiard hall was doing brisk business.\nSeveral say the heat created by the first blast was \"as hot as the surface of the sun\".\nThe explosion left no gaping crater, and its impact did not wreck the nearest buildings.\nBut it set off secondary fires which turned out to be the most deadly of all.\nTheir devastating impact was then multiplied by a series of safety failures.\n\"There were no fire escapes,\" laments Sadiq Maroof, a shopkeeper who was one of a small number of people who escaped alive.\nHe takes me through the skeletal remains of the Laith Centre, from the blackened basement where he once ran two popular clothing shops, to the second floor room where he fled for his life.\n\"The stairs behind me were on fire so we pulled a window out of its frame and jumped.\"\n\"There had been two escapes,\" he says, still visibly angry and upset. This tragedy took the lives of nine people from his own family and many close friends.\n\"The first floor exit had been turned into a shop and the second floor escape became a storage room.\"\nSeveral experts estimated the initial bomb would have killed 20-30 people. The ensuing inferno then trapped many inside.\n\"The absence of fire escapes and safety regulations caused the highest number of casualties,\" says retired Brigadier General Khalaf Abdul Karim who was at the scene that night.\n\"We could hear people trapped inside desperately calling their family and friends for help. In those minutes some could have been saved.\"\nThe fire tore through shops with cheap styrofoam walls and bad wiring, with perfumes and other goods fuelling the flames.\nEach time we went to the street, grieving relatives approached us with harsh words for their emergency services, accusing them of arriving too late, and of not doing enough.\nWhen I ask Chief Sergeant Habib Dewan about the accusations, he immediately bursts into tears.\n\"We normally reach the scene in 4-5 minutes but we reached it in 8- 10 minutes,\" the fireman says.\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" he says of the blazing orange fireball which engulfed the entire street.\n\"We were ready to jump into the fire to save people. We did everything we could but this was an over-whelming attack.\"\nThere are many Iraqi stories about how a van was able to enter a street only used for pedestrian traffic.\nSome versions speak of a driver carrying official badges, others of the complicity of the security guards at the nearest checkpoints.\nBut this biggest single attack on civilians since the Iraq war of 2003 has finally focused official attention on the widespread use of detector \"wands\" which were proven long ago to be fake.\nIn the wake of this bombing, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi finally ordered their removal from checkpoints.\n\"Well - trained sniffer dogs are what's needed to stop these devices \" says one explosives expert in Baghdad.\nSecurity experts say even IS may not have expected to inflict such a high number of casualties in their Karrada bombing. \"They got lucky,\" is how one put it.\nBut life was pulled out of a Baghdad neighbourhood which still mourns its great loss.", "answer": ["On a Baghdad street once throbbing with life, there is a soft recitation of prayers, a silent lighting of candles, and quiet sobbing at the edges of charred ruins."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "While many elderly and disabled people in the UK are used to visits of just 15 minutes from a carer, Buurtzorg employs qualified nurses who stay as long as they think is necessary.\n\"We focus on craftmanship,\" said the founder and director of Buurtzorg, Jos de Blok.\n\"If you, as a nurse, have a good education then you know how to organise your work yourself.  In a team with 10-12 nurses you can be responsible for all the patients in a neighbourhood.\"\nThere are no managers and patient satisfaction is the highest for any care organisation in the country. The costs per client are 35% less than the Dutch average. Buurtzorg has also been voted the Netherlands' best employer three years in a row.\n\"Before they introduced me to Buurtzorg, I was with another organisation and that was rubbish,\" said 83-year-old Fred de Smet, from Utrecht.\nHe has been receiving care from Buurtzorg nurses for several years following a stroke, heart problems and leukaemia.\n\"They treat me well, they take care of me. You are a human with them and they don't start saying, we only have X amount of hours or so many minutes to change my support stockings or shower me.\"\nAs well as organising social care, some of the nurses in Amsterdam run a radio show, called Radio Steunkous - which translates to \"radio support stocking\".\n\"Our motto is that everyone can be each other's support stocking,\" said nurse and presenter Ellie Lakerveld.\n\"Our goal is to provide another form of healthcare. A lot of people we visit are bound to their houses or their beds, and radio plays an important part in their lives.\"\nRadio Steunkous runs features which might be of interest to those receiving care, mingled with classic songs from previous decades.\nBuurtzorg itself recreates a system from a past era.\n\"This is the way I worked in the 80s,\" says Jos de Blok, who was a community health nurse.\n\"We didn't have management then. We were responsible for everything. Give trust to the nurses, they have intrinsic motivation.\"\nMr de Blok hopes to encourage other countries to adopt his model. He arrives in Scotland only a few days after returning from Japan, which also has a care system based on short visits.\n\"I understand how these systems developed through the years because it's what we had in Holland.\n\"But it becomes more and more difficult for nurses to do the work in a way they are satisfied. The way it's organised with many management layers makes it even worse. Then you get this vicious circle. Control becomes more. The pressure on costs becomes higher.

At the moment, it's our life.\n\"Some people do think we're a bit mad,\" added Nancy.\n\"But I find it therapeutic.
