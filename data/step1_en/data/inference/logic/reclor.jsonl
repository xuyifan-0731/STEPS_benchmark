{"question": "Sociologist: Some economists hold that unregulated markets should accompany democratic sovereignty because they let people vote with their money.

{"question": "In opposing the 1970 Clean Air Act, the United States automobile industry argued that meeting the act' s standards for automobile emissions was neither economically feasible nor environmentally necessary. However, the catalytic converter, invented in 1967, enabled automakers to meet the 1970 standards efficiently. Currently, automakers are lobbying against the government' s attempt to pass legislation that would tighten restrictions on automobile emissions. The automakers contend that these new restrictions would be overly expensive and unnecessary to efforts to curb air pollution. Clearly, the automobile industry' s position should not be heeded.

{"question": "In the past decade, two Motorlux models, the T-300, a sports car, and the AG-75, a sports utility vehicle, have been manufactured with the same timing belt, which controls the timing of the engines valves: when the engine is running at a higher RPM, there is more strain on the timing belt. Recent evidence indicates that this particular brand of timing belt has a usable life of about 135, 000 miles, somewhat less the 200, 000 miles life typical of standard timing belt. Although the same model of timing belt has been used for both models of cars, the incidence of timing belt failure is considerably higher in the AG-75 than in the T-300.
