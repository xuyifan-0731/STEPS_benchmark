The ninth paragraph describes the students' reaction to Miss Spivey's announcement that she had seen camels on her trip to Baghdad: \"We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.” Mavis reminds the other students that camels appear in a story they are familiar with. Thus, when Miss Spivey announces that she had seen camels, the students' reaction suggests that they are baffled.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because when Miss Spivey announces that she had seen camels, the students' reaction suggests that they are baffled, not delighted (choice A), fascinated (choice B), or worried (choice D)."}, "choices": ["(A)delighted.", "(B)fascinated.", "(C)baffled.", "(D)worried."], "answer": "(C)baffled."}

Eppie was a creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her.\" These lines make clear that in contrast to Silas's gold, his new daughter is vibrant and alive.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines from the first paragraph cited above reveal Eppie's interest in \"living sounds\" and \"living movements\" and thus characterize her vitality in comparison to the gold, rather than her durability, protection, or self-sufficiency."}, "choices": ["(A)vitality.", "(B)durability.", "(C)protection.", "(D)self-sufficiency."], "answer": "(A)vitality."}

In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race.

Her central claim is not that men and women need to work together to change society (choice B), that moral rights are the distinguishing characteristic separating humans from animals (choice C), or that there should be equal opportunities for men and women to advance and succeed."}, "choices": ["(A)The rights of individuals are not determined by race or gender.", "(B)Men and women must learn to work together to improve society.", "(C)Moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals.", "(D)Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish."], "answer": "(A)The rights of individuals are not determined by race or gender."}

Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family's ink shop. The narrator's father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father's interactions with a customer. Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink's quality. This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, \"I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.\" Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator's thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn't the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage describes the narrator's surprise visit to the ink shop and a reunion with her uncles, these events occur in the first paragraph. Therefore, choice B doesn't provide the best summary of the passage as a whole. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the narrator doesn't make any reference to her father's ambitions."}, "choices": ["(A)A character's arrival at her family's ink shop sparks fond memories of her favorite aunt.", "(B)A character's surprise visit leads to a happy reunion at her family's ink shop.", "(C)A character comes to understand her father's ambitions while visiting her family's ink shop.", "(D)A character's visit to her family's ink shop deepens her appreciation of her family's work."], "answer": "(D)A character's visit to her family's ink shop deepens her appreciation of her family's work."}
