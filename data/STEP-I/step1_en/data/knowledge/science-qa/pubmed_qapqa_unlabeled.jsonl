This challenges the widely held presumption that 'the net will close' around a manageable group of individuals-at-risk if several risk factors are jointly considered. As the finding of this study arises in one of the world's most long- and healthy-living populations, it raises several practical as well as ethical questions.", "label": "QA"}
