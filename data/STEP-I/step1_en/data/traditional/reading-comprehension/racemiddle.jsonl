{"background": "This year the US will honour  one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from?\nThe answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883).\nThe famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)?\nWith little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing.\nOn the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs.\nThis _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\".\nThe most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself. Huck did not enjoy schooling. It shows in the way he uses language, in a spoken style. Only a master like Twain could copy the way a young southern boy talked so well.", "question": "What is the passage mainly about?", "choices": ["Mark Twain's career as a great writer.", "Mark Twain's interest in describing local life.", "Mark Twain's achievements in American literature field.", "Mark Twain's life experiences which influenced his writing."], "answer": "D", "label": "MUL"}

Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.\nIt isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.\nScientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.\nLike muscles, willpower can 'get tired'.

Ginger, for example, is a common spice in Chinese cooking. Ginger gives food a nice flavor. The Chinese began to use ginger many years ago. They used ginger not because it tasted good. They used ginger because it was medicinal. Ginger, they thought, was good for the digestion. It also helped people who had colds.

Google engineers have discovered that even 400 milliseconds--as short as the blink of an eye--is too long for most Internet users.\nA millisecond is one thousandth of a second. People hardly notice such a small time difference, but it does cause them to stop searching, reported The New York Times. \"Without question, nobody likes to wait,\" said Arvind Jain, a Google engineer. \"Every millisecond matters.\"\nNowadays, millions of smart-phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information. With so many people downloading maps, sports videos, news and restaurant recommendations, you can get digital \"traffic jams\". Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service.\nGoogle found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result.\nEven so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times.\nTrying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet. In the 1990s, when the World Wide Web first started to become popular, it was very crowded and slow; people called it the \"World Wide Wait\". But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions. They laid a lot of fiber optic cables  for sending in high speed; they improved software so it would work more smoothly; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users; all this increased speed.\nNowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet.

A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.\n\"Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,\" Olson told Reuters. \"It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.\"\nThe research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.\n,,.", "question": ".
