{"question": "Spain's Golden Age: Under Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain underwent a dramatic transformation. In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alcázar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message. He tried thereafter to pay more attention to his Spanish constituency. \n\nDecide whether \"Because the King secluded himself in the royal residence of Toledo\" is a valid answer to the following question: Why were the Spanish people unhappy with Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson, Charles V?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "The driver of the Facel Vega car, Michel Gallimard, who was Camus's publisher and close friend, also died in the accident. In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France. He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work. Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died.

{"question": "Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U.S. personnel. It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret.

Thats why his law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation. Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way. This is the reason the apple falling from the tree and the Moon being held in orbit is the same. Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth. In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you. Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity.

{"question": "The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

{"question": "Mary, Queen of Scots: The baby was Mary Stuart, who at the age of nine months was crowned Queen of Scots at the Chapel Royal, Stirling. When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin François, son of the French king. François II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth — the \"Virgin Queen\" — had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones.

Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to — and from — Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c.

That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.

Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.

The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.  In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.

{"question": "Abrasion is another type of weathering. Like ice wedging, it is a form of mechanical weathering. Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind. It is like sand-blasting a rock. \n\nDecide whether \"Tornadoes\" is a valid answer to the following question: What causes rocks to move?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}

The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of \"And Justice for All,\" which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. \"And Justice for All,\" which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway.

{"question": "The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

{"question": "When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations. Camus put the painter and set decorator Mayo, who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels (The Stranger - 1948 Ed.), in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets. \n\nDecide whether \"1945\" is a valid answer to the following question: When did Camus defend the French Government?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}

He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots.

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability.

{"question": "The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. \n\nDecide whether \"Supports specific Defense Department or military service needs\" is a valid answer to the following question: What does the sole element of the intelligence community (independent from a cabinet agency) do?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}

{"question": "Women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment opportunities in the United States, but discrimination remains a significant problem, according to a study to be released today by two professors at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark. The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain.

England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin François, son of the French king.

{"question": "During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.

{"question": "The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

{"question": "Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.

With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.

For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

{"question": "If there were any words capable of conveying horror to the mind of the old banker, they were convents, priests, and papacy,--of which the lawyer was well aware when speaking thus of his sister. Mrs. Bolton was certainly not addicted to papistical observances, nor was she at all likely to recommend the seclusion of her daughter in a convent. All her religious doctrines were those of the Low Church. But she had a tendency to arrive at similar results by other means. She was so afraid of the world, the flesh, and the devil, that she would fain shut up her child so as to keep her from the reach of all evil. Vowed celibacy was abominable to her, because it was the resource of the Roman Catholics; and because she had been taught to believe that convent-walls were screens for hiding unheard-of wickedness. But yet, on behalf of her child, she desired seclusion from the world, fancying that so and so only might security be ensured. Superstition was as strong with her as with any self-flagellated nun. Fasting, under that name, she held in abhorrence. But all sensual gratifications were wicked in her sight. She would allow all home indulgences to her daughter, each under some separate plea,--constrained to do so by excessive love; but she did so always in fear and trembling, lest she was giving some foothold to Satan.

{"question": "Spain's Golden Age: Under Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain underwent a dramatic transformation. In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alcázar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.

The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.

{"question": "New Horizons: Exhausted after the Civil War, Spain remained on the sidelines during World War II and began to recover economically under the oppressive, law-and-order regime of Franco. There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow.

{"question": "In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

Durer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of Stefan Lochner), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired van Eyck's altarpiece), and Zeeland. Durer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented. While providing valuable documentary evidence, Durer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Durer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, Margaret of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met Bernard van Orley, Jan Provoost, Gerard Horenbout, Jean Mone, Joachim Patinir and Tommaso Vincidor, though he did not, it seems, meet Quentin Matsys.

It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering. As soon as he was free to do as he pleased, therefore, it was natural that he should rewrite his poems and publish them. \n\nDecide whether \"He didn't have the affection for him Mrs. Allen did and didn't understand his peculiar and erratic nature\" is a valid answer to the following question: How did Mr. Allen feel about Poe?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Einstein and Maric married in January 1903. In May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910. In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie. Einstein married Elsa Lowenthal on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States.

{"question": "Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.

{"question": "Abrasion is another type of weathering. Like ice wedging, it is a form of mechanical weathering. Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind.

In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force.

{"question": "Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U.S. personnel. It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work.

{"question": "When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations.

{"question": "During the transition, Bush had chosen John Ashcroft, a former senator from Missouri, as his attorney general. On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002.

{"question": "In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained. The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received.

While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.

{"question": "On December 4, as news came in about the discoveries in Jordan, National Security Council (NSC) Counterterrorism Coordinator Richard Clarke wrote Berger, \"If George's [Tenet's] story about a planned series of UBL attacks at the Millennium is true, we will need to make some decisions NOW.\" He told us he held several conversations with President Clinton during the crisis. He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks.\" Mike was not diplomatic,\" Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home.\" The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates.

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. \n\nDecide whether \"A Rolex watch\" is a valid answer to the following question: Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant who is accused of helping plan a murder and get what?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}

{"question": "Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.

{"question": "During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages.

{"question": "The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey's mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed. \n\nDecide whether \"Joey ate breakfast\" is a valid answer to the following question: What happened before Joey went swimming in Aunt Julie's pond.\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising. Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden. \n\nDecide whether \"Could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia\" is a valid answer to the following question: What are the reforms seen as?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Hurlburt Field, Florida (CNN) -- An Air Force CV-22 Osprey crashed Wednesday during a routine training mission north of Navarre, Florida, injuring five crew members aboard, a military official said. The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006. They were first deployed by the Marines in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development. \n\nDecide whether \"Mexico\" is a valid answer to the following question: What states has the Osprey crashed in?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Abrasion is another type of weathering. Like ice wedging, it is a form of mechanical weathering. Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind. It is like sand-blasting a rock. \n\nDecide whether \"Abrasion\" is a valid answer to the following question: What are two types of weathering?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "The Earth is tilted 23 1/2 on its axis. This means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights. At the same time the other hemisphere has shorter days and longer nights. For example, in the Northern hemisphere summer begins on June 21. On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun. This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is pointed The hemisphere that is tilted away from the Sun is cooler because it receives fewer direct rays. As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall. The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring. When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa. What does this mean for you? If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day. If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat. At the equator, the seasons never change. As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.

{"question": "Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U.S. personnel. It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\" Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret.

{"question": "The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. \n\nDecide whether \"The dci is confirmed by the senate\" is a valid answer to the following question: Who is the DCI confirmed by and how much power does he or she have?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}

{"question": "When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations.

{"question": "In many parts of the world, trees lose their leaves in autumn. The leaves turn color. Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position.

{"question": "Renewable resources can be renewed as they are used. An example is timber, which comes from trees. New trees can be planted to replace those that are cut down. Sunlight is a renewable resource. It seems we will never run out of that! Just because a resource is renewable, it doesnt mean we should use it carelessly. If we  aren't careful, we can pollute resources. Then they may no longer be fit for use. Water is one example. If we pollute a water source it may not be usable for drinking, bathing, or any other type of use. We can also overuse resources that should be renewable. In this case, the resources may not be able to recover. For example, fish are renewable resources. Thats because they can reproduce and make more fish. But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low. Figure 2.16 shows another example. \n\nDecide whether \"Fish are renewable resources but water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low\" is a valid answer to the following question: How can we overuse resources that should be renewable?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Spain's Golden Age: Under Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain underwent a dramatic transformation. In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alcázar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

{"question": "Hurlburt Field, Florida (CNN) -- An Air Force CV-22 Osprey crashed Wednesday during a routine training mission north of Navarre, Florida, injuring five crew members aboard, a military official said. The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006. They were first deployed by the Marines in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development. \n\nDecide whether \"18 years\" is a valid answer to the following question: When the Marines deployed the Osprey, how long had it been in development?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States.

Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities.

Mrs. Bolton was certainly not addicted to papistical observances, nor was she at all likely to recommend the seclusion of her daughter in a convent. All her religious doctrines were those of the Low Church. But she had a tendency to arrive at similar results by other means. She was so afraid of the world, the flesh, and the devil, that she would fain shut up her child so as to keep her from the reach of all evil. Vowed celibacy was abominable to her, because it was the resource of the Roman Catholics; and because she had been taught to believe that convent-walls were screens for hiding unheard-of wickedness. But yet, on behalf of her child, she desired seclusion from the world, fancying that so and so only might security be ensured. Superstition was as strong with her as with any self-flagellated nun. Fasting, under that name, she held in abhorrence. But all sensual gratifications were wicked in her sight.

Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force. It also depends on the objects mass. Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do. You may pick up a baseball.

{"question": "Albert Bandura OC (/baen'dU@r@/; born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University. For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

{"question": "The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.

Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.

He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000.

{"question": "The Romans: Legend says Rome was founded by Romulus, sired with twin brother Remus by Mars of a Vestal Virgin and abandoned on the Palatine Hill to be suckled by a she-wolf. Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to — and from — Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters. The Third and final Punic War ended in 149 b.c. , though national solidarity was still a long way off.

{"question": "The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \"Fort of Eidyn,\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin François, son of the French king. François II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope.

{"question": "Cavour was a younger son of a noble Piedmontese family, and entered the army in 1826, serving in the engineers. His liberal sentiments made him distrusted by the government of Charles Felix as a dangerous man, and he was doomed to an inactive life in an unimportant post. He soon quitted the army, and embarked in business operations as manager of one of the estates of his family. For twelve years he confined himself to agricultural labors, making himself acquainted with all the details of business and with the science of agriculture, introducing such improvements as the use of guano, and promoting agricultural associations; but he was not indifferent at the same time to public affairs, being one of the most zealous advocates of constitutional liberty. A residence in England gave him much valuable knowledge as to the working of representative institutions. He established in 1847 a political newspaper, and went into parliament as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1848 he used all his influence to induce the government to make war with Austria; and when Charles Albert abdicated, and Victor Emmanuel became king, Cavour's great talents were rewarded.

{"question": "During the transition, Bush had chosen John Ashcroft, a former senator from Missouri, as his attorney general. On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002.

{"question": "The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. \n\nDecide whether \"The President\" is a valid answer to the following question: Where does the CIA submit recommendations for organizational changes based on information collected?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}

{"question": "Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\" By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out.

Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.

{"question": "During the transition, Bush had chosen John Ashcroft, a former senator from Missouri, as his attorney general. On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002.

Smith practiced law for a living until 1982. Since then, he's been semi-retired, devoting himself to helping fellow seniors who are needy. \"I'm getting unable to do much physically, but my brain hasn't quit,\" said Smith, who walks with a cane. \"And I'd rather people ask a foolish question now than have them make a dumb mistake later.\" Smith and Sketchley helped Beatrice Jackson at the Smith Williams Center on Wednesday. Jackson, who said she was \"over 60,\" needed help with estate planning. \"He's not through with me yet ... but he's done a real good job,\" said Jackson, a retired state worker.

{"question": "During the transition, Bush had chosen John Ashcroft, a former senator from Missouri, as his attorney general. On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism.

{"question": "While the Base Ball writers of the cities which comprise the Southern Association have no organized membership similar to the Base Ball Writers' Association of the major leagues and the organizations which are best known as the class AA leagues, they are a clever, hard-working group of young men, who have labored in season and out of season, not only to build up Base Ball but to build it up on the right lines.  Experience of more than a quarter of a century has most abundantly proved that the standard of Base Ball has steadily been elevated.  It needs no compilation of fact nor any dogmatic assertion on the part of the Editor of the GUIDE to attest that fact.  It is a present condition which speaks for itself.  The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.  In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.  Later there came a season when the commercial end of the game tended to encroach upon the limits of the pastime.

{"question": "Spain's Golden Age: Under Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain underwent a dramatic transformation. In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain. Spain flourished during a Golden Age, a century of Spanish economic and political supremacy in international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and literature. Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish. The first of the Habsburgs, he packed his retinue with Burgundian and Flemish nobles. Soon after his arrival in Spain, the young man inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V. The responsibilities of the crown kept him busy away from the royal residences of Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, and Madrid. While the monarch was away on one of his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out in a number of Spanish cities, including Madrid. The rebels occupied the alcázar, which had by then been converted to a royal palace. The insurrection was quashed and its leaders executed, but the king got the message.

The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain.

England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin François, son of the French king.

{"question": "New Horizons: Exhausted after the Civil War, Spain remained on the sidelines during World War II and began to recover economically under the oppressive, law-and-order regime of Franco. There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root—too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still...\n\nDecide whether \"1975\" is a valid answer to the following question: When did tourism in Spain explode into an annual southern migration?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}

They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called \"Tete\" (for petit), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, including full-time after her death. The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy. In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be\" while his wife was pregnant with their second child.

It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo, \"I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ...\" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States.

In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.

{"question": "(CNN) -- Air New Zealand's latest in-flight safety video, released Tuesday, is already another viral hit but is encountering some turbulence over its use of several bikini-clad Sports Illustrated models. View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling \"The world's most beautiful safety video.\" The \"Safety in Paradise\" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. \"It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me,\" one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video.

When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the \"Rough Wooing. \" The English king ordered his general to \"burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. \" But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin François, son of the French king. François II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth — the \"Virgin Queen\" — had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones.

{"question": "Maximilian's death came at a time when Durer was concerned he was losing \"my sight and freedom of hand\" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of Martin Luther. In July 1520 Durer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, Charles V, who was to be crowned at Aachen. Durer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of Stefan Lochner), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired van Eyck's altarpiece), and Zeeland. Durer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented. While providing valuable documentary evidence, Durer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Durer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, Margaret of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met Bernard van Orley, Jan Provoost, Gerard Horenbout, Jean Mone, Joachim Patinir and Tommaso Vincidor, though he did not, it seems, meet Quentin Matsys. At the request of Christian II of Denmark, Durer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw \"The things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\"--the Aztec treasure that Hernan Cortes had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico.

With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway.

In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious.

{"question": "While the Base Ball writers of the cities which comprise the Southern Association have no organized membership similar to the Base Ball Writers' Association of the major leagues and the organizations which are best known as the class AA leagues, they are a clever, hard-working group of young men, who have labored in season and out of season, not only to build up Base Ball but to build it up on the right lines.  Experience of more than a quarter of a century has most abundantly proved that the standard of Base Ball has steadily been elevated.  It needs no compilation of fact nor any dogmatic assertion on the part of the Editor of the GUIDE to attest that fact.  It is a present condition which speaks for itself.  The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.  In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.  Later there came a season when the commercial end of the game tended to encroach upon the limits of the pastime.  This has been repressed in the last two seasons and to-day the morale of Base Ball is of a higher type than it ever has been in the history of the pastime. \n\nDecide whether \"Raised\" is a valid answer to the following question: Has repression of the tendency to win by any means raised or lowered the morale of Base Ball?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}

{"question": "The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.  By the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.  My search had shown me nothing fresh.  Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.  I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.  For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.  I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.  Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.  Yet, I would not shirk the work.  I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.  Besides, as I reassured myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered, only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on my person. \n\nDecide whether \"It's huge and weird\" is a valid answer to the following question: Why was he afraid to go into the cellar?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Sally had a very exciting summer vacation. She went to summer camp for the first time. She made friends with a girl named Tina. They shared a bunk bed in their cabin. Sally's favorite activity was walking in the woods because she enjoyed nature. Tina liked arts and crafts. Together, they made some art using leaves they found in the woods. Even after she fell in the water, Sally still enjoyed canoeing. She was sad when the camp was over, but promised to keep in touch with her new friend. Sally went to the beach with her family in the summer as well. She loves the beach. Sally collected shells and mailed some to her friend, Tina, so she could make some arts and crafts with them. Sally liked fishing with her brothers, cooking on the grill with her dad, and swimming in the ocean with her mother. The summer was fun, but Sally was very excited to go back to school.

{"question": "Historically, LSEO letter-writing campaigns generated from $11,000 to $25,000 annually, recalls Dallas Ferguson, a Tulsa attorney and board president of the new LASO. That amount hardly offset enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp., the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies. Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits. Many are senior citizens. Riggs regrets that retired Tulsa attorney John Athens, a champion of legal aid, did not live to see how much the money has meant. Athens died last year. In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H. Harbaugh, foundation trustee and a colleague of Athens at the Conner & Winters law firm, said his mentor had \"a special interest in people who could not afford legal services. He was aware of the hot line and supported its expansion.\" Said Riggs: \"We use lofty phrases such as 'with justice for all,' when we talk about our legal system. That phrase is etched on our U.S. Supreme Court building. Those are just empty words if people don't have access to that system.\" \n\nDecide whether \"$200,000 to expand a client hot line\" is a valid answer to the following question: What amount did the Oxley foundation donate and what was it used for?\nAnswer yes or no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
