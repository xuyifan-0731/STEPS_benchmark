It's a matter of time.\r\nLuisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.\r\nLeu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.\r\nLuisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.\r\nLeu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?\r\nLuisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!\r\nLeu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.\r\nLuisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.\r\nLeu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.\r\nLuisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.\r\nLeu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?\r\nLuisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.\r\nLeu: Therapy?\r\nLuisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.\r\nLeu: Nor can I.\r\nLuisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.\r\nLeu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.\r\nLuisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...\r\nLeu: Right you are! \"The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different.\" Do you remember?\r\nLuisa: \"Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. Such is life.\"", "answer": ["Luisa has had no luck selling her house yet. It took Leu 2 year to sell his apartment. Bill has a drinking problem. Luisa has stopped trying to help Bill.
