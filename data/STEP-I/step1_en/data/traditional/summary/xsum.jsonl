The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961.\nBy 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute.\nHe went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941.\nBy the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy.\nHaving bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators.\nHe also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking.\nThe Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack.\nStigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy.\nBut he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd.\n\"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.

{"question": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nAccies survived some nervous moments before Ash Taylor headed the Dons ahead after 34 minutes.\nBut the lead only lasted four minutes as Dougie Imrie scored from the penalty spot after Danny Redmond was challenged by goalkeeper Joe Lewis.\nRooney pounced when Gary Woods parried a James Maddison shot, before Accies' Scott McMann was shown a late red card.\nThe win - thanks to the Irish striker's 11th goal this season - takes Aberdeen to within four points of second-placed Rangers in the Scottish Premiership table.\nAccies remain second bottom without a victory in 10 games since beating the Dons in October.\nAberdeen were fluid and dangerous from the off, exposing Accies' weakness on the left flank, with Louis Longridge inexperienced in a full-back role against Jonny Hayes.\nMark Reynolds netted early on, but referee Andrew Dallas saw pushing and ruled it out, perhaps a touch harshly as the Dons defender didn't appear to be the culprit.\nIt seemed only a matter of time for the home side, with visiting defenders struggling to cope with the recurring threat.\nOne corner in particular caused chaos involving a Reynolds header that was saved, an overhead kick clearance and a follow up effort from Andrew Considine with the ball eventually forced behind.\nChances and corners flowed. Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.\nThe breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.\nIncredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.\nTaylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.\nThe goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.\nAberdeen responded well to that set-back, with Woods superbly tipping Taylor's drive over before Rooney appeared to be pushed in the box, but pleas were ignored.\nThe Dons went forward relentlessly. Manager Derek McInnes made a positive move, bringing on Maddison for Considine and it proved decisive.\nIt was Maddison's shot that Woods palmed back into play perfectly for the onrushing Rooney to net.\nMcMann prevented a third, hauling Hayes to the ground just outside the box that earned a red card with the winger in on goal.\nNo-one could realistically argue Aberdeen did not deserve the win. What is unclear is how they did not make it far more comfortable\nIt was a fourth successive defeat for Hamilton, albeit in a very tough run of fixtures. What will be more alarming for manager Martin Canning is the lack of wins in the last two months.\nAt times, the visitors were hanging on by a thread, struggling to contain the attacking threat they faced.\nThey had a fabulous chance for a second shortly before Rooney's goal and that would have made a huge difference.\nShay Logan gave possession away, Rakish Bingham surged clear and found Ali Crawford, but the midfielder could not get enough on his shot to beat Lewis while the goalkeeper was grounded. He should have scored.\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"We passed up so many opportunities. It was one-way traffic in the first half.\n\"By and large I felt we were on the wrong end of a few decisions today and I thought we still managed to thoroughly deserve three points.\n\"Reynolds scores a perfectly valid goal. There was no infringement by Rooney. He was nowhere near the goalkeeper. For me it was a poor decision. We should be up and running with that goal.\n\"We had a penalty kick given against us that's not a penalty. Twice now we've played Hamilton, two poor penalty decisions against us.

At the time, the German empire was a military ally of the Ottomans, and is accused of knowing about the massacres and not doing anything to prevent them. So for many Germans this resolution is about facing up to German historical guilt - something modern Germany is founded upon.\nBut the big question is what this all means for Europe's attempts to solve the migrant crisis.

From its design to its destination, this attack underlines that IS has found a new way to inflict harm and cause terror.\n\"Daesh used, for the first time, a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints,\" a Western security source in Baghdad tells me, using the name for IS more commonly used in the region.\n\"We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying.\"\nPrecise details of the attack, which is under Iraqi investigation, are still being pieced together.\nThe tactic known as a VBIED - vehicle-borne improvised explosive device - is now widely used in suicide bombings.\nBut this one is said to differ in the way the explosives were placed in the van, and how the chemicals were put together.\n\"It's really difficult to make,\" an explosives expert who has knowledge of the investigation explained, saying the device may have been developed in the Iraqi city of Falluja when it was under IS control.\n\"Daesh has given a lot of thought to how to move through checkpoints.\"\nThe bomb-makers are believed to have taken a formula \"available on the internet\", and then adjusted the quantities to reduce its risk of detection, and increase its impact.\nSeveral Iraqi experts also described the mix of chemicals as \"unique\".\n\"We are used to big fires but the chemicals in this bomb were used for the first time in Iraq,\" says Brigadier General Kadhim Bashir Saleh of the Civil Defense Force.\n\"It was unique, strange, and terrible.\"\nAnother Iraqi security expert, Hisham al-Hashimi, told me he believes a similar mix of explosives may have been used, only once, in an attack by al-Qaeda in 2004.\nBut he describes this new tactic deployed by IS as \"very serious and dangerous\".\nThe van exploded on the narrow street just after midnight shortly before Eid Festival when shops were packed with families, football fans were glued to big screens, and the billiard hall was doing brisk business.\nSeveral say the heat created by the first blast was \"as hot as the surface of the sun\".\nThe explosion left no gaping crater, and its impact did not wreck the nearest buildings.\nBut it set off secondary fires which turned out to be the most deadly of all.\nTheir devastating impact was then multiplied by a series of safety failures.\n\"There were no fire escapes,\" laments Sadiq Maroof, a shopkeeper who was one of a small number of people who escaped alive.\nHe takes me through the skeletal remains of the Laith Centre, from the blackened basement where he once ran two popular clothing shops, to the second floor room where he fled for his life.\n\"The stairs behind me were on fire so we pulled a window out of its frame and jumped.\"\n\"There had been two escapes,\" he says, still visibly angry and upset.

In a team with 10-12 nurses you can be responsible for all the patients in a neighbourhood.\"\nThere are no managers and patient satisfaction is the highest for any care organisation in the country. The costs per client are 35% less than the Dutch average. Buurtzorg has also been voted the Netherlands' best employer three years in a row.\n\"Before they introduced me to Buurtzorg, I was with another organisation and that was rubbish,\" said 83-year-old Fred de Smet, from Utrecht.\nHe has been receiving care from Buurtzorg nurses for several years following a stroke, heart problems and leukaemia.\n\"They treat me well, they take care of me. You are a human with them and they don't start saying, we only have X amount of hours or so many minutes to change my support stockings or shower me.\"\nAs well as organising social care, some of the nurses in Amsterdam run a radio show, called Radio Steunkous - which translates to \"radio support stocking\".\n\"Our motto is that everyone can be each other's support stocking,\" said nurse and presenter Ellie Lakerveld.\n\"Our goal is to provide another form of healthcare.

We were responsible for everything. Give trust to the nurses, they have intrinsic motivation.\"\nMr de Blok hopes to encourage other countries to adopt his model.

{"question": "The agent, known by the alias Jack King, infiltrated a group of pro-German activists in south-east England in a previously unknown wartime operation.\nHis undercover work led to the identification of hundreds of people willing to pass secrets to the enemy.\nFiles in the National Archives describe King as a \"genius\" at his work.\nBy Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News\nWe had known that MI5 controlled German spies dropped into the UK under the Double Cross system but little was known about operations to control domestic sympathisers. This one began in a low-key manner with a correspondence club in which lonely people would write to each other but it would lead to the identification of potentially hundreds of people in Britain willing to help the Nazis.\nSince Britain was never invaded, it's impossible to know how the country would have actually reacted, but the files suggest there were at least a few hoping for Hitler to take over and actively offering assistance.\nThe role of the MI5 agent Jack King is also intriguing. Quite who he was seems something of a mystery but senior officials in MI5 clearly rated him highly for his ability over years to undertake risky work in reeling in more and more Nazi sympathisers by convincing them he was linked to the Gestapo - and doing so without ever getting too close to provoking them to do anything too damaging.\nIn 1942, King - also referred to as SR in the files - met Marita Perigoe, described as a \"crafty and dangerous woman\" of Swedish and German origin.\nDespite being married to a member of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, she had no time for the group and regarded them as \"insufficiently extreme\".\nMI5 said of her: \"She was found to be so violently anti-British and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her.\"\nIt went on to say she was not a \"neurotic nor feminine type; she is masterful and a somewhat masculine woman\".\n\"Both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant hun.\"\nKing managed to convince her that he was a representative of the Gestapo looking for people who were \"100% loyal to the Fatherland\" and could be relied on in the event of an invasion.\nHe exploited the group's taste for the cloak-and-dagger aspects of espionage work by offering them invisible ink for secret communications and arranging meetings in the basement of an antiques shop.\nMI5 regarded some members of the group as unstable but warned they were still dangerous.\nHilda Leech was \"unstable and neurotic\" and was trying to pass on reports of highly secret research on jet aircraft, while astrologer Edgar Whitehead  - a \"bit of a mystery man\" - was passing on information about secret trials on an amphibious tank.\nMI5 drew up plans to issue members with special badges to be worn in the event of an invasion - supposedly to identify them as friends to the Germans but in fact to enable them to be swiftly rounded up by the police.\nBy the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents working directly to King - all but one of them British.\nMI5 estimated the number of their contacts who had been the subject of King's intelligence reports ran \"certainly to scores and probably to hundreds\".\nIn other declassified files released by the National Archives, it emerged that English actor Michael Redgrave met Guy Burgess, one of the Cambridge spies, while his theatre group toured Moscow.\nThe meeting in 1958 with his old friend from Cambridge University proved to be of interest to MI5, which was desperate to find out all it could about what was said.\nBurgess, who had fled to Russia seven years earlier, turned up drunk at the theatre where Redgrave was starring in Hamlet.\nBut the two had lunch together the following day at Burgess' flat, provided by the KGB after his defection.\nThe British ambassador at the time said Redgrave had not been very communicative about the meeting and had not consulted the embassy about it beforehand.\nBurgess, however, wrote a letter home to his mother - intercepted by MI5 - delighting in the \"fine gossips\" shared and gushing over Redgrave's acting.\n\"It's certainly the best Hamlet I've ever seen - better than Gielgud, better than Olivier, much better than Paul Schofield.\"", "answer": ["An MI5 agent pretending to have Gestapo links secretly controlled a vast network of UK-based Nazi sympathisers, newly-released files reveal."], "label": "SUM"}

The manager who led the Gulls back the Football League, Paul Buckle, former defender Guy Branston, whose last Torquay game was the 2011 League Two play-off final, and life-long supporter Steve Breed give BBC Sport their theories:\nThis season Torquay have had 14 different players join on loan, while three free agents arrived well after the season had begun.\n\"The people you bring to the club are important and they have to know what entails playing for Torquay,\" said Buckle.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I used to say that if I got the right vibe, that they were really on board with this, then I'd go with it, if not I'm not interested.\n\"I wouldn't allow anyone to come to the club unless I was really sure they were right.\"\nAnd Branston believes there are not enough players in the current side with the correct mentality.\n\"It's important that the lads have got to be here for the right reasons,\" he said.\n\"I know a lot of Alan Knill's lads were brought in on good contracts and he brought in a lot of loan players, but I think for a club like Torquay, you've got to make sure you've got the right players. Signing them from the pre-season onwards is big for a club like Torquay.\n\"Plus you've got to be looking to produce your own players that have the right mentality for what the club stands for and what it's all about.\n\"It's having that togetherness as a group, and if you're constantly bringing in loan players it disrupts that core.\"\n\"I didn't think it was significant at the time,\" said Breed.\n\"But in hindsight it clearly was, because we were doing OK up until when Martin went off sick.\n\"With Alan Knill coming in at the back end of that season, he said he saved us, and ultimately he picked the team that kept us in the League, but only in that last game.\n\"I think it was a major problem when Martin went off and maybe not a lot of thought had gone into moving Martin and bringing in Knill at the time.\n\"Martin's said he'd have liked to have come back and perhaps that wouldn't have been a bad idea in hindsight.\"\nBut Branston, who left Torquay in the summer that Ling took over, says the managerial change was justified: \"Unfortunately for Ling he lost his job because the team wasn't winning football matches.\n\"Yes his illness took over and we now know more about it, but they were still losing football matches.\n\"The players shouldn't be affected by what's going on off the pitch, they should deal with it and carry on that mentality that Martin Ling had carried over from Paul Buckle.\"\nTorquay's top scorer is winger Jordan Chappell with five goals, the last of which was scored on 26 October. Joint-second are centre-backs Aaron Downes and Krystian Pearce, with four apiece.\nThe club has used 13 different recognised strikers, either on loan or as permanent signings, with the best return being just three goals.\n\"I think people will quickly say Torquay's biggest problem was not scoring enough goals, but I think you have to look deeper,\" said Branston.\n\"You have to look at the mentality of the players that have been brought in, the ethos of the club.\n\"The team have had a lot of 1-0 defeats, which shows to me that you can't score goals and you can't see out games.\n\"The mentality of a player has to be that if the forwards aren't doing it, then the defenders should be doing it.\"\nBut Breed disagrees and says Knill's decision to sign players like Karl Hawley and loanee Callum Ball just before the start of the season had a big effect.\n\"Our recruitment last summer was poor under Alan Knill, he recruited players on two-year contracts that have done nothing for us.\n\"Hawley and Ball came in a couple of days before the first league game and straight away started the opening game against Wimbledon and just didn't do it for us.\n\"The situation was allowed to continue until we got a forward in like John Marquis, who did OK for us.\n\"But Elliot Benyon simply hasn't scored enough goals and they have had the chances, they have had the supply line.\"\n\"It is difficult, but it'll be made easier that Luton are out of it now,\" says Buckle, who as well as guiding Torquay to promotion from the Conference, also managed Luton last season.\n\"You don't want too many clubs in there on big money who are trying to buy their way out, so to speak.\n\"But I don't think it's as strong as it has been and I'm hopeful that they can recreate what we did and get back.\n\"Torquay are a Football League club, we've proved that, but we've got to get the right people in. Chris Hargreaves knows that.\"\nBranston feels it is important that the club can get rid of the players who do not want to be at the club, and bring in experienced winners.\n\"You have to change quickly. As soon as the pre-season starts you wipe the slate clean, you get out the core element of the problem, whatever that may be.\n\"You bring people in who've won the Conference and played in the Conference who have the right mentality to take clubs forward and you breed players off that.\n\"You produce you own players who have got the ethos of Torquay United in their veins from when they're 15, 16 or 17 years-old. Where are those players? Why haven't we seen those players for three or four years?\"\nBut Breed is not so sure: \"When we went down last time, that summer we recruited Paul Buckle, we had a new manager, we had almost a complete new team and we had a new board of directors.\n\"There was a real feel-good factor, we played Grays Athletic in our first home game and there were 4,500 people here and everything seemed really new.\n\"Now we're going down again and the manager we've got here I feel is struggling very badly, there's no new board of directors and finances are an issue.\n\"You lose a lot of money coming down.\n\"I'll be very surprised if Torquay ever become a League club again.

{"question": "King Salman's decree also means Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, will become deputy prime minister while continuing as defence minister.\nPrince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, has been removed from his role as head of domestic security, state media say.\nHe has pledged allegiance to the new crown prince, his younger cousin.\nSaudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s.\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman's rapid ascent is seen by the younger generation as a sign that things are changing.\nBefore his latest promotion, he was responsible for leading Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, overseeing the kingdom's energy policy and economic reform.\nHe must have already ruffled a lot of feathers in a royal family that was used to being presided over by a succession of elderly men, the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports.\nHis father King Salman is 81 and reportedly not in the best of health, our correspondent adds.\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman could, potentially, lead Saudi Arabia for decades, heralding a long period of internal stability.\nHowever, the new crown prince is close to US President Donald Trump, and could ratchet up pressure against Iran - which would raise tensions in the region.\nThe rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been meteoric.\nWhen I met him in Jeddah in 2013 he described himself as simply \"a lawyer\". Today he is a heartbeat away from ruling the most powerful country in the Arab world.\nDespite being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's damaging and inconclusive military campaign in Yemen, he is largely popular at home, especially with younger Saudis.\nHe has swept away many of the ineffective timeservers in government offices and replaced them with young, Western-educated technocrats. He has set out a possibly over-ambitious development plan, \"Vision 2030\", and announced plans to sell off part of the vast state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco.\nHe has also forged ties with Washington and the Trump administration.\nBut his biggest and most risky move may yet prove to be his bid to curb the power of the conservative religious establishment. Washington likes this move, but others closer to home do not.\nThe founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud), had dozens of sons, and there are as many as 15,000 princes and princesses in the royal family.\nIn 2006, a decree was passed setting up a committee responsible for electing the king and crown prince. The committee is made up of senior princes of the Al Saud royal family and is known as the Allegiance Council.\nMohammed bin Salman's new promotion to crown prince was approved by 31 out of 34 members of the council.\nAnalysts say those in power tend to appoint their sons to roles that will enhance their chances of being promoted - so when monarchs and crown princes change, sons can come into and out of favour.\nKing Salman, a son of King Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the death of his half-brother Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz.\nHe launched his first major cabinet reshuffle a few months later, promoting Mohammed bin Nayef to crown prince and Mohammed bin Salman, who was relatively unknown at that time, to deputy crown prince.\nExperts say the second reshuffle has reduced uncertainty over the line of succession, and means the king has averted a potential power struggle between his son and his nephew.\nThe decree promoting Mohammed bin Salman includes a clause preventing him from appointing one of his own sons as his heir.\nIt is the most influential Arab country - and a key ally of Western powers including the US and the UK.\nThe kingdom is also the world's second largest oil producer - and the Saudi royal family is thought to be one of the richest ruling families in the world.\nIt is guardian of the two most holy sites in Islam, and regards itself as leader of the Sunni community worldwide.\nThe kingdom is a key player in Sunni attempts to block Shia Iranian influence in the Middle East.\nIt has launched air strikes on Yemen to fight Houthi rebels, who Saudi Arabia believes are backed by Iran. However, the campaign has been criticised for human rights violations - including the killing many civilians.\nRecently, Saudi Arabia also joined efforts to impose a blockade on Qatar.\nPrince Mohammed bin Nayef was the kingdom's security chief for many years and was known for his strong stance against jihadist militants.\nAs deputy prime minister and interior minister, he headed up the counter-terrorism portfolio, and also had good relations with Saudi Arabia's Western allies.\nState media broadcast footage showing Mohammed bin Nayef meeting Mohammed bin Salman after the succession was announced.\nThe former crown prince said \"I am content\" and \"I am going to rest now. May God help you\", while the new heir replied \"May God help you. I will never do without your advice\".\nReaction to the appointment of the new crown prince was largely (and unsurprisingly) celebratory, although Saudi Arabia's regional rivals took the opportunity to criticise the kingdom.\nSaudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV ran blanket coverage and emphasised the positive effect the appointment had on the country's stock exchange.  Similar reports appeared in other friendly Arab states.\nBut in Iran - Saudi Arabia's bitter rival - several news outlets described the appointment as a \"soft coup\".\nSimilar language was used by the Pro-Qatari HuffPost Arabi, which called the appointment \"a coup in the royal palace\".\nSyrian state media's largely neutral report came with a considerable sting in the tail.\nCoverage ended with a reminder to viewers of a \"tyrannical regime\" which \"lacks the most basic democratic principles\" and \"supports terrorism\".\nJihadists on social media celebrated the reshuffle, anticipating that the changes would pave the way for internal strife within the House of Saud and eventually bring about its downfall.", "answer": ["Saudi Arabia's king has appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince - replacing his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, as first in line to the throne."], "label": "SUM"}

Previously, some people had to pay several thousand pounds towards repairs.\nHowever, houses built since 2009 will not be covered by the scheme. This was done to discourage developers from building on land at risk of flooding.\nBusinesses are also excluded, as are landlords who take out insurance policies on homes they do not occupy themselves.\nThe scheme has also been criticised by a group of climate change experts, who said it did not offer good value for money.\n\"It achieves very poor value for money because it is trying to subsidise the costs of flooding, rather than addressing the causes and trying to prevent flooding in the first place,\" said Daniel Johns, head of adaptation on the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nInitially 17 insurance companies are taking part in the scheme.

{"question": "Look around the world and every other major football club has a women's team, or plans for one. Two of the biggest, men's Champions League finalists Real Madrid and Juventus, are about to set up theirs.\nMost of those teams are fully integrated with the rest of the club and being backed financially too - a few miles from Old Trafford, for example, Manchester City's commitment to their women's side is clear.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton are the only other Premier League side not to have an affiliated women's team, although they have just announced a new under-21 team for next season, giving a pathway for the young female players in their girls' sides - something United's girls do not have.\nLocally, nationally or globally, whichever clubs United compare themselves to, they are allowing themselves to be left behind.\nI don't understand why.\nWhen people have talked about this issue in the past, they have focused on how, with the club's vast resources and worldwide profile, a United team would help develop the women's game.\nThat is still true, but it now works the other way too - United are missing out on an easy way of engaging with their huge female fanbase, in Manchester and further afield, and promoting the importance of women in the make-up of their club.\nA women's team would do all of that. The game is growing fast and other clubs have demonstrated they believe it is a big commercial asset, at very little cost.\nWhy do United think differently?\nWhen the BBC asked United last week about the prospect of them forming a women's team, the club responded by saying: \"It is a matter that is under review and a detailed analysis is currently being undertaken.\"\nTaken in isolation, that reply gives the impression it is an issue being actively discussed by the club.\nThe problem for me with just accepting that is the case and leaving them to get on with it is that United have been saying the same thing for several years now, since 2013.\nWhoever asks them about a women's team - and many people from United fans to MPs and national newspapers have done so down the years - United's stock reply is the matter is \"under review\".\nHearing it repeated again and again makes it feel like a brush-off.\nThe BBC's request for an interview was turned down but, if I was given the chance to ask United any questions, I would like to know who is actually carrying out this review and analysis.\nWho have they been talking to since 2013, what have they found out so far, is there any evidence a review has been happening - and, crucially, when is it likely to end?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nUnited did have a women's team until the Glazers scrapped it in 2005, with a spokesman saying \"it was not part of their core business\".\nI can actually understand why they may have made that decision at the time - United were outside the top two divisions of the old Women's Premier League and the Glazers might not have considered them a good representative of their brand.\nAlso, the profile of the women's game in the UK was a lot smaller then.\nBut that was 12 years ago and things are very different now - from the level of professionalism at the top level of the women's game here to the way it is marketed and the commercial opportunities that come with that.\nSo, if United's decision-makers are purely concerned with financial matters and still basing their views on women's football on what was happening when they ditched their women's team, they are well out of touch.\nI also wonder if the demographic of United's board has anything to do with the club's current stance.\nOf the 13 members listed on the United website, their average age is almost 50 and only one is female - Darcie Glazer Kassewitz, who is rarely seen at Old Trafford.\nUnited are not the only Premier League club whose board is predominantly male and middle-aged, but maybe their thinking boils down to the fact there is nobody in a position of power at United who believes women's football is important enough to be a proper part of the club. If they think that, why not just say it?\nThen there is the question of whether they are also scared of failing on the pitch.\nIt is only four years since Manchester City obtained a Women's Super League licence. Since then, their investment in their women's team and its integration with the men's facilities and resources, has proved a great success. They won the domestic treble last season, and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.\nCity's men's team have finished above United in each of the past four Premier League seasons - could United be frightened that, if they had a women's team, it would be overshadowed by City too?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAt the moment, United do have girls' teams, up to the under-16 age group.\nThose sides have been very successful, something that is rightly trumpeted by United but, unlike the boys' sides, they are run by the Manchester United Foundation as a Regional Talent Club, not the club itself.\nThat's an important difference - the girls' teams wear United shirts but they use separate facilities and rely on separate funding and grants, only some of which comes from the club.\nWhen I talk to parents of girls who play for those teams, some of them say they don't feel a full part of the United family. I can understand why.\nBefore the Women's Super League was set up in 2014, some clubs tried running their women's team through their community arm and, with that set-up, it almost feels like they are associated with the club but being kept at arm's length.\nThankfully, things have moved on and girls' and women's teams are now far more integrated at most other Premier League clubs including Spring Series winners Chelsea, whose girls' teams are also run as a Regional Talent Club but are based at the club's main Cobham training ground.\nUnited's girls train in Eccles, nine miles away from the club's Aon Training Complex in Carrington, which is where the United boys' teams play.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhoever United are talking to as part of their ongoing review about a women's team, it does not appear to be anyone at the United Foundation involved in their girls' teams.\nWhen I've spoken to people who work there, it is almost a taboo subject. Nobody wants to go on the record to say they think the club needs a women's team, even if privately they are frustrated and think it is long overdue.\nAs well as the fact United are missing out financially by not having a women's team, there is a human cost too.\nThe talented local girls, who United are developing as they come through their ranks in their teams from under-8s upwards, have nowhere to go past the age of 16.\nThey have the same dream as the likes of United striker Marcus Rashford - to play professionally for their local team, who they grew up playing for and supporting.\nWomen's football is a career now but, unlike Rashford, girls cannot pursue it at United.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEngland Under-17 goalkeeper Emily Ramsey is a United fan from Salford and had played for them since the age of eight.\nBut, now she is 16, she had to leave this summer because she did not have a team to play for, and joined Liverpool instead.\nI spoke to Emily and her mum, Kate, as part of Women's Sport Week, and Kate explained the different opportunities available to her daughter at Liverpool.\nUnited are one of the top regional talent centres for girls and Emily grew up there, and had some amazing experiences.\nBut she has gone from being the oldest and best keeper there to being part of a much bigger - and fully professional - set-up at Liverpool, where she can train and learn from England goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain.\nEmily is in a great position now and clearly enjoying her football with Liverpool but it must have been very hard for her to leave United. For someone in her position, it must seem like the club you love does not love you.\nNot every girl who plays for United is as lucky as Emily. Most of her former team-mates are going through a succession of trials to try to find a new club, at the same time as sitting their GCSEs.\nIf they get an offer - and they will not find out for several weeks and after several trials - they might not be able to accept it because of logistical issues - transport, travel time, expense - the sort of thing that did not affect them at United.\nIt is hard enough to make it as a professional anyway and the reality is that some of them will stop playing at a high level, and not because of a lack of ability.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEvery year, the same problem occurs and, whether United like it or not, their lack of clarity over settling the issue is affecting younger girls too.\nAs her mum explained, when Emily joined United to play for their under-9 team, they knew there wasn't a women's team then but they were hoping there would be by the time she was old enough.\nUnited stalling over whether they will set one up has probably influenced a few other players about whether to play for their girls' teams or not.

{"question": "None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.\nAll have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult.\nSpending: Â£2,057 per person\nKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.\nThe system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.\nThe story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004.\nThe proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.\nAn estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.\nIt comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row.\nThe number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.\nNHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a Â£22bn target for 2020.\nThis has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.\nSpending: Â£2,125 per person\nKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.\nThe system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.\nThe story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK.\nDuring the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.\nExactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.\nIn response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at \"breaking point\".\nA 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.\nThe plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings.\nIt did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.\nPolitical instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.\nSpending: Â£2,160 per person\nKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.\nThe system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs.\nThe story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best.\nWeekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.\nMuch of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together.\nBudgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.\nBut most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives.\nArguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.\nIn terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.\nSpending: Â£2,084 per person\nKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.\nThe system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at Â£60 a week.\nThe story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as \"exceptional\".\nSome hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.\nThe government invested an extra Â£50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.\nBut the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.\nAnd the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.\nWales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls.\nInstead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases.\nAmbulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.\nOver 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.\nDo you have a question about the NHS?

Most people would have passed out in about 10 minutes.\n\"Thankfully I was so fit I could withstand it. Six hours is a good effort,\" he told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"It's ironic, that because I am so fit and did so much exercise it ultimately saved me. It's a funny one.\"\nTaylor's heart condition - Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) - gets worse with exercise, but had never been diagnosed until he felt ill during pre-season with Nottinghamshire in April.\nRetirement was inevitable, and the internal defibrillator he had fitted two months later has already saved his life for a second time.\n\"My operation was not to make anything better,\" he said. \"This condition can't get better, but if something goes wrong it is a safety net.\n\"If it happens again - and it has - it certainly did its job. It gave me a massive shock. But it did its job.\"\nTaylor treasures the memories of what proved to be his farewell to international cricket.\nHe played in all four matches in last winter's series win over South Africa, taking two stunning catches in the brilliant third Test victory in Johannesburg.\n\"Who would have thought my best moment in cricket was my last moment in cricket?\" said Taylor, who won seven Test caps.\n\"All I wanted in my career was to play for England and I had fought so hard and there had been so many ups and downs. I felt I should have played far more than I did.\n\"Then it was all taken away from me. It kind of summed up my career. I got there and it got taken away from me.\n\"The best moment I have ever had in my life was one of the last days playing cricket for England, catching those catches in Joburg, winning that game with England, playing for your country amongst some great guys.\n\"It doesn't get much better than that. I achieved it, but I just did it less than I imagined and hoped. But I can't complain.\"\nTaylor does not complain because he is still alive, but the stubbornness which underpinned his cricket career very nearly led to his demise when he knew all was not well playing for Notts against university side Cambridge MCCU in April.\n\"It was very lucky a few things happened,\" the ex-Leicestershire player said, recounting the sequence of events and \"what ifs\" that led to his diagnosis.\n\"I am lucky I have a girlfriend for starters - in a lot of ways! I am lucky that Jose was off work and I rang her to say I was ill.\n\"And if I hadn't forgotten my keys for my house I wouldn't have got my mum involved. She found me curled up in a ball. If she hadn't come, I wouldn't have got in my house and I don't know what I would have done.\n\"Then I didn't listen to my mum in terms of going to hospital, but Jose drove two and a half hours from Shropshire to see if I was all right. She realised things weren't all right and made me go to to hospital in the end. If she wasn't off work then things might have been very different.\"\nTaylor spent almost three weeks in hospital and the \"incredible\" NHS staff saved his life - of that he has no doubt.\nHe was rushed in after being sick and was quickly hooked up to various machines, but the memory of hearing his heart pounding will stay with him forever.\n\"The sound was the worst thing,\" he explained. \"Hearing how fast my heart was going was a crazy thing and I needed it to stop. Luckily I was in great hands.\"\nHis heart withstood the equivalent of running five marathons in six hours.\n\"The City hospital and the QMC in Nottingham were phenomenal,\" he added. \"The doctors and nurses were outstanding. They acted so quickly.\"\n\"I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for social media,\" Taylor admitted.\nDealing with his situation became significantly easier thanks to the support he received from \"hundreds and thousands of people\" who contacted him saying his stoicism was a big inspiration.\n\"As a professional cricketer you distance yourself. You don't read everything because it can mess with your head,\" he added.\n\"I was in hospital for a week before anybody knew about it. I had 26 million tweets to me, about me, in the first two hours of the news coming out and it got to 60 million in 24 hours - which is phenomenal.\n\"The positivity coming my way was like I had died.

I feel I can make a difference with the coaching.\"\nEnforced retirement and a change in career was not what he wanted, of course.

The Addicks and Barker reservoirs, built by the government in the 1940s to hold back excessive rainwater along the bayou, store more than half a billion cubic metres of water between them, and the US Army Corps of Engineers has rated the decaying dams around the reservoirs as \"extremely high risk\".\nThe flooding in the surrounding neighbourhoods would last at least four to five weeks, warned Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist at the Harris County Flood Control District. On Tuesday he advised anyone still there to get out. \"Once the water comes into the street, you aren't going to be able to leave,\" he said.\nIn the Colonies neighbourhoods, just streets away from where water flows from the reservoirs into the bayou, a volunteer army had brought together jeeps, pick-up trucks and military surplus vehicles to rescue stranded residents. Organised on Facebook by two local off-road recovery groups, and manned from a makeshift radio control centre a few miles away, the group scoured the flooded streets for anyone stuck in their home.\nJosh James, 26, waded through chest-high water to get people onto a truck.\nHe helped Christie Mueck and her husband out of their house with their dog. Newlyweds, the couple moved to the neighbourhood just two months ago from Layfayette, Louisiana.\n\"I have five years of research in that house,\" said Ms Mueck, holding back tears. \"Everything's in there. If it washes away, I won't get my PhD.\"\nWith 12 evacuees and five dogs, and its huge wheels completely submerged, the truck began to make its way back to higher ground. It was one of six being operated by the volunteers in the area, Mr James said, along with 40 boats and a host of smaller off-road vehicles.\nAll around the Addicks reservoir, volunteers were out in the water, some well-equipped and tightly organised, others making use of whatever they had to hand. With no work while the nearly oilfield is closed, Anthony Kacala, Bertley Taylor, and Michael Hernandez grabbed a canoe and a rubber dinghy and searched online for trouble spots.\nThe three friends rescued 12 people from flooded homes nearby on Monday night, they said, before loading up Facebook to check where else they might be needed.\nOn another street nearby, Octavio Zambrano, 27, was driving his military surplus jeep around with three friends, offering help to anyone in need. Brian Foreman, 34, came in a boat to rescue his father, then stuck around to help, ferrying a woman back to her house to retrieve medicines and clothes.\nThe fleet of volunteer rescue vehicles went in and out of the worst-affected areas, searching for anyone left behind. The truck containing the Muecks slowly made its way to a staging area. The couple said they would try to connect with family members, or else join the nearly 20,000 people around the city preparing to spend the night in a shelter.\nAs water began pouring out of the Addicks reservoir on Monday, two local schools were transformed into makeshift shelters. By that night they were full and began turning people away.\nSome 1,100 people had crammed into Morton Ranch High School, bedding down along the corridors and in the canteen. The handful of inflatable beds available were given to the elderly and the sick, everyone else slept as best they could on the floor.\nSat at a canteen table on Tuesday, looking shattered, Latonia Buckley held her two infant daughters in her arms. Twenty-four hours earlier, she had put the two girls onto a mattress and floated them out of the house as the water poured in.\nThe family had one more night available at the shelter, then they would have to leave. With her home wrecked, and more water threatening to spill from the reservoir into the neighbourhood, going home was not an option.\n\"We have nowhere else to go, we are facing sleeping in our car tomorrow night,\" she said. \"When we opened the car door earlier, water poured out.\"\nLike many people making a makeshift home at the school, Ms Buckley had no flood insurance. \"It's devastating,\" she said. \"You can't protect your kids, you can't provide for your kids. It's doesn't matter what you have in the bank, you have nowhere to go.\"\nDespite the releases on Monday, water was still pouring over the Addicks reservoir spillway at an uncontrolled rate on Tuesday evening. At the Barker reservoir, the water level was rising and threatening to spill over.\n\"We just don't know exactly how this is going to play out because its never happened before,\" said meteorologist Mr Lindner.\nThe most difficult question for many of those bedding down at Morton Ranch High School for a second night seemed to be one of the most simple: What next?\n\"I really don't know,\" said Ms Buckley. \"Pray, I guess.\"", "answer": ["As the rain began to fall harder around Bear Creek Village on Tuesday, Leticia Lopez and her husband Edgar Fernandez huddled under an awning, pausing for a cigarette and a final look down the street in the direction of their house."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Will he be less outspoken? Will he temper his Twitter tirades? Will he back down from his calls for a Muslim ban?\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nBut there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.\nHere are five.\nMr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.\n\"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,\" he posted on Facebook back in September. \"I am only working for the people of the US!\"\nEven though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.\nNow, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (ÃÂ£307,850) per person.\nMr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.\nMr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.\n\"I don't have pollsters,\" he said last August. \"I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.\"\nIn fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.\n\"Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,\" he told the Associated Press.\nThat was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.\nAccurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.\nAt least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.\nLike many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.\n\"I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,\" he said in October. \"Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.\"\nPart of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.\n\"I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,\" he said in January. \"In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.\"\nThen Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.\nHis campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.\nThis, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents \"the natural maturation of the campaign\".\nOver the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.\n\"They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'\" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. \"And they let us down.\"\nNow Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and \"planted seeds\" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\nOn Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.\nIn the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.\nOn Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.\nWhile one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.\nIt looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.\nAll of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.\nWhile no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.\nThat may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.", "answer": ["Donald Trump has effectively won the Republican presidential nomination, leaving pundits and analysts wondering if a rhetorical \"pivot\" to a general election campaign is in the works."], "label": "SUM"}

This can include financial abuse.\nAs a result, the Police will be given training in how to spot instances of coercive control.\nPolly Neate, the chief executive of Women's Aid, believes the law will encourage victims to come forward.\n\"We know of many cases where women have not come forward about controlling coercive abuse - including financial abuse - because they feel the Police won't take any action unless they've been physically assaulted.\nWe're hoping this new law will change that,\" she says.\nBut there is widespread concern about another development - the roll-out of Universal Credit (UC).\nThe benefit is paid monthly on a household basis. The TUC report warns that UC will make it easier for one partner to control the finances.\nEven though the DWP has promised to make split payments where necessary, Polly Neate thinks many victims will still acquiesce.\n\"Universal Credit, as currently planned, is another tool for people who want to financially abuse their partner,\" she claims.\nMoney Advice Service 0300 500 5000\nNational Domestic Violence Helpline 0808 2000 247\nFor Jane - as for many couples - having a joint account was a particular difficulty.

{"question": "Some see in this the potential for a new era in Russian-French relations. Maybe not the strategic alliance of old, but certainly an end to the modern-day chill.\nEvents have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin.\nFor France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing.\nToday there are more pressing concerns.\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS.\nRealities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication.\nBut still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player.\nAs one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\"\nPresident Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin.\nFirst he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS.\nSecond, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad.\nThe French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader.\nIt took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge.\nBut there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack.\nThere are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement.\nFirst of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh.\nThis has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy.\nSecond, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend.\nStraight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato.\nThe Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis.\nIt was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit.\nIn the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity.\nFrance and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination either by outsiders (the US) or insiders (Germany).\nThroughout the last three centuries the two countries have been periodic allies - notably in the run-up to World War One.\nBut also President Charles de Gaulle himself - though viscerally anti-Communist - kept his distance from the Americans by flirting with the Soviet Union.\nWhat could be more natural - say Kremlin insiders - than for France to resume its natural role, triangulating between Washington and Moscow?\nBut tempting as this might sound to some in France, there is no geostrategic shift in the offing.\nFor one thing the French do not trust Vladimir Putin.\nFor another, the two countries still have opposing visions on too many key issues.\nFrance will never abandon Ukraine. And in the Middle East, France's allies are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia - not the Shia axis backed by Russia.\nThere is a concordance of interests bringing Paris and Moscow together.

{"question": "Even organising matches is difficult. Visas are hard to come by and world football's governing body rules mean Tibet can only play other unrecognised teams.\nThe Tibetan football team is one of the main obstacles for China. They didn't like the Tibetan football team\nAfter five years without a game, the Tibetans - whose national team are nicknamed the Forbiddens - finally took to the field again when they competed in the 25th All India Shaheed Dal Bahadur Durgamal Mal Gold Cup, with teams from across India, Nepal and Bhutan.\nThe tournament took place in Dharamsala, Northern India, the current home of Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile. Fearing for his life, the 77-year-old was forced to flee Tibet in 1959 after years of violent conflict between Tibetan rebels and the Chinese army.\nThe Tibetan National Football Association was only set up in 2001. In that same year the team played its first match, a 4-1 loss to Greenland in Copenhagen.\nBut as Tibet's coach Kalsang Dhondup told the BBC's World Football programme, football is something the estimated 150,000 exiles feel very passionate about.\n\"Football was introduced by the British into Tibet in, I think, 1904,\" said Kalsang. \"Since then the Tibetans love football and physically the Tibetans are very much suited to football. Football is the most popular game in Tibet.\"\nIronically the British were in Tibet on a military expedition fearing Russia's growing influence in the region.\nBut now Tibet, in the north-east of the Himalayas, faces a very different problem.

At the same time I feel proud to represent Tibet and also feel responsible for the Tibetan cause.\"\nAnd, as Kalsang explains, the team have a big fan in the shape of the Dalai Lama.\n\"I think His Holiness has support for Tibetans in all issues,\" he stated. \"Even sport also.

When I was small there was no place for me to play football. If I play, the ball will fall from Potala (Palace) and then the ball will be lost.'
