{"question": "Ben Mee is more concerned with the impact Burnley’s win could have on their bid for Premier League survival than the blow it has dealt to his old club Manchester City. Sale-born Mee captained City to victory in the FA Youth Cup in 2008, just four months before the Abu Dhabi takeover, but was one of a number of youngsters who realised their futures lay elsewhere. Having achieved his Premier League ambitions with Burnley, the 25-year-old left back is desperate to keep them there over the final nine games of the season after a surprise win over the champions. Ben Mee says Burnley deserves a stroke of luck after this tackle was deemed OK by referee Andre Marriner . City right back Pablo Zabaleta clearly disagreed as the penalty should was waved away in his side's 1-0 loss . Mee, with Burnley keeper Tom Heaton, says the win was 'definitely a statement' for his side . ‘We’re still in it as we always have been, but this is definitely a statement,’ said Mee. ‘Teams will be a bit shocked we’ve managed to get three points. City have got a lot to do now. 'I had a couple of mates in the City end and I’m driving two of them home so I’ll enjoy that.’ Mee was relieved that referee Andre Marriner didn’t award a penalty for his challenge on Pablo Zabaleta late in the game. He added: ‘You always worry the referee has seen it from an angle and will give it, but we deserve a bit of luck.’ The left back attempts to console City's Sergio Aguero after the match which ended in a massive upset .

{"question": "An Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death testified Wednesday that she would 'rather die' than hurt the little girl, and denied making her run as punishment. Joyce Hardin Garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. When defense attorney Richard Rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt Savannah or any other grandchildren, Garrard replied, 'I'd rather die first.' The 49-year-old Garrard said she and Savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking, taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play. She said she was telling Savannah the importance of not lying. Took the stand: Joyce Garrard, 49, took the stand in her own defense Wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10-year-old granddaughter Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy . 'I was picking up sticks with her because I felt just as responsible for her lying as she was,' Garrard testified. Prosecutors say Garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy. 'It was 'more like a jog and not a run,' Garrard maintained. Garrard said Savannah was such an active child, the only way to hold her attention was to keep her moving. 'We was hooting and hollering, fussing back and forth,' Garrard said. Garrard said they picked up sticks for about 40 minutes, but spent much of the day in the yard. She said Savannah told her she had to go to the bathroom and they were racing into the house when the girl fell backward. Garrard said that's when she told Savannah's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, to call 911. 'Did you have some intent to hurt Savannah?' Rhea asked. 'Not that day or any other day,' Garrard replied. Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), 9, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right) One word on a 911 recording could help decide Garrard's fate. With 9-year-old Savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone, Joyce Hardin Garrard asked for something — either a cigarette or a blanket. The request, depending on exactly what she said, could be considered callousness or compassion. On the Feb. 17, 2012, recording, played in court Tuesday, Garrard is heard in the background as the girl's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, talked for more than 11 minutes with Lori Beth Beggs, a 911 operator in Etowah County. 'My daughter had a seizure,' Hardin says at the beginning. Speaking in a loud voice as Hardin talks to Beggs, Garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child's name and asking her to wake up. 'Savannah. Savannah,' Garrard says in a steady voice. 'Savannah, open your eyes.' Then, nearly three minutes into the recording, with Savannah still unresponsive, Garrard makes a request. 'Give me a smoke,' Beggs testified the woman said. The defense maintains she said: 'Give me a throw,' referring to a small blanket. While jurors have listened to the recording, Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree refused to let them see a transcript of the audio prepared for the defense. What the jurors believe she said could be vital. If Garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying, jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours. If they believe the woman said 'throw,' jurors could see that as sign Garrard was worried and trying to help the girl. Other testimony showed that the girl was wrapped in a small blanket when firefighters and paramedics arrived. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death wasn't Gerrard's fault . Prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine Garrard later Wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney. Garrard faces a death sentence or life without parole if convicted of capital murder. The girl's stepmother is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped. A defense expert said in dramatic testimony Tuesday that he wouldn't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death, yet he agreed the child wouldn't have died without exhausting physical exertion. Questioned by an attorney for Garrard at her capital murder trial, forensic pathologist Dr. James Lauridson indicated he couldn't say someone else caused the death of Savannah Hardin, 9. 'Knowing what I know I would not have called this a homicide, I would have called it indeterminate,' said Lauridson, retired chief medical examiner for Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Lauridson — using water, dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency — said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started seizing. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Jurors paid close attention to Lauridson, standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony. Garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter's death wasn't a homicide. But under cross-examination by prosecutor Marcus Reid, Lauridson admitted he didn't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to Dr. Emily Ward, the state pathologist who ruled that the girl's death was a homicide. Her decision was crucial to the decision to charge Garrard. Neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old Boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop, and Reid drove home the point to jurors. 'It was running that killed her. Isn't that right?' Reid asked Lauridson. 'Yes,' Lauridson replied. Lauridson's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator Chris Crow, who helped Ward with the post-mortem investigation of Savannah's death. Crow testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy. The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said. Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as 'pretty quick' for such an examination. But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed, and Ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garrard, who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012. Garrard, of Boaz, says she is innocent. Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state. Defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death .", "answer": ["Joyce Garrard, 49, is charged with killing 10-year-old Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy .\nGarrard took the witness stand Wednesday to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin .\nGarrard's lawyers haven't denied that the girl ran before her collapse, but the defense said the woman had no intention of harming her granddaughter ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "New Zealand reached their first ever World Cup final as they secured a sensational four-wicket Duckworth/Lewis win over South Africa at a sold out Eden Park on Tuesday. An explosive 49 off 18 balls from South African batsman David Miller saw New Zealand set 298 (D/L) to chase for victory, after a burst of rain reduced the match to 43 overs per side. In response, Brendon McCullum blazed his way to 59 and despite the regular loss of wickets, Grant Elliott smashed the penultimate ball for six to lead New Zealand to a tense victory.

The dejection is clear to see on the faces of the South Africans, after they failed to make it over the line . There was an added spice to the match with neither side having ever previously made it past the semi-finals. New Zealand’s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in Auckland. But, following their quarter-final victory over Sri Lanka, South African captain AB de Villiers said his side embraced the tag of ‘chokers’ and were striving under the pressure. Having won the toss South Africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw Vernon Philander replace the heretofore-impressive Kyle Abbott. With arguably the best attack of the World Cup, New Zealand’s pace bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee were successfully swinging the ball and causing the opposition openers all sorts of problems. AB de Villiers falls over the stumps after failing to gather the ball cleanly to run out Corey Anderson . The anguish is clear on De Villiers' face as he let the momentum shift away from South Africa in the semi final . De Villiers has been one of South Africa's stars of the tournament, but his mistake cost his side dear . New Zealand celebrate after taking a wicket during the first innings of their semi-final against South Africa . Du Plessis top-scored for South Africa with 82, as the Proteas scored 281 in a rain-interrupted innings . Corey Anderson, who was expensive but took three of five wickets, celebrates Rilee Roussow's dismissal . David Miller blasted three sixes in his quickfire 49, which boosted the South African score at the end . Somewhat surprisingly the Black Caps’ fielding early on let them down, as first Quinton De Kock was dropped on six by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi off Boult. Hashim Amla was then put down three balls later on naught at long leg, with Boult the guilty party this time, after he hit a top-edge off Southee. Nonetheless, the tournaments leading wicket-taker redeemed himself in the following over as Boult followed up a bouncer with an in-swinger that took Amla’s (10) inside edge and cannoned into middle stump, with Eden Park erupting in jubilation. Attempting to release the shackles, De Kock (14) shuffled down the wicket to Boult and as he swung hard at a full ball, a thick edge flew to third man and South Africa were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs. Slow starts coupled with explosive finishes have the been framework for many of De Villiers side’s innings during this World Cup and their efforts in Auckland was following the same suit. Required to rebuild, Faf du Plessis and Rillee Rossouw put on an 83-run third-wicket partnership to steady the ship. De Villiers hit another impressive 65, continuing his excellent form, as South Africa accelerated their innings . The South African captain salutes the crowd after reaching yet another half century . However, McCullum brought on Corey Anderson and he sent down a bouncer that hit the shoulder of the Rossouw’s bat and was caught one-handed by Martin Guptill at backwards point to dismiss the left-handed batsman for 39. As De Villier’s came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps. But, the right-handed batsman remained un-fazed and in typical style he took the attack to the opposition. Kane Williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the South African captain and New Zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope. As Du Plessis and De Villier’s partnership passed the 100-run mark some unscheduled rain arrived to check their progress on 216-3 after 38 overs. It was an interruption that undoubtedly favoured New Zealand, just as South Africa looked like they were ready to explode and by the time the skies cleared the match was reduced to 43 overs per side. Having anchored his sides innings Du Plessis was dismissed for 82 off the second ball after the restart, as he gloved a bouncer from Anderson to Ronchi behind the stumps. For South Africa it turned out to be the perfect catalyst for an exciting end as Miller entered and smashed six fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 49. With 65 runs hit off their final five overs after the delay the Proteas posted 281-5, setting New Zealand a challenging 298 (D/L) to win. Brendon McCullum flicks the ball away as he got New Zealand off to a blistering start in their chase . McCullum's combination of clever shotmaking and explosive power set New Zealand up for a win . Morne Morkel hit back for South Africa, dismissing McCullum and Kane Williamson in quick succession . McCullum, who has become known for thriving on leading from the front, signaled his intent in the first over of his sides innings as he sent a short Dale Steyn delivery over extra cover for a maximum. Although Guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the West Indies in fourth quarter-final - was looking uncomfortable, his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half-century off just 22 balls. South Africa’s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so De Villiers turned to his energetic spinner Imran Tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen. And, McCullum (59) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to Morne Morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out Steyn at mid-on. Williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom-edged a short Morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six. New Zealand were faltering and Ross Taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling Guptill short as he found himself run-out for a scratchy 34.

Duminy (left) celebrates with Du Plessis as South Africa appeared to take control of the contest . Taylor was caught behind for 30, as New Zealand struggled to keep up with the rate . It was fifth bowler JP Duminy who then provided the next crucial breakthrough for South Africa as Taylor was brilliantly caught behind by De Kock for a run-a-ball 30. The match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over. As Elliott pushed the ball to point, Anderson called for a run and as he was sent back De Villiers missed a golden opportunity to run-out the stranded batsmen, hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball. A superb 103-run fifth-wicket partnership between Elliott and Anderson looked to have taken New Zealand to the brink of victory. However, Anderson skied a Morkel delivery to Du Plessis at square-leg for 58 and Ronchi holed-out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch. Anderson (above) and Elliot settled the hosts' nerves with a brilliant partnership of 103 . Anderson punished De Villiers for his missed run out as the game hurtled towards a tense climax . With New Zealand 273-6 and requiring another 26 runs off 16 balls, South Africa missed another crucial run-out opportunity, Elliott this time the lucky survivor. The 36-year-old right-handed batsmen sent a length Morkel delivery high into the evening Auckland sky but the ball fell agonizingly between two Proteas players. Morkel’s final delivery was again pulled high into the air by Elliott but just as Farhaan Behardien looked set to catch it Duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground. Steyn, battling injury, was brought on for the final over with New Zealand requiring 12. And Eden Park erupted in euphoria as Elliott (84 not out) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the South African players collapsed to the ground in despair. There is an undeniably belief within the crowd that their side has one more victory in them that will bring New Zealand their elusive first World Cup title. Du Plessis keeps his cool to take a vital catch and dismiss Anderson, setting up a thrilling finish . Du Plessis cannot hide his jubilation as the semi-final came right down to the wire in Auckland .

{"question": "(CNN)Newly released al Qaeda documents, including letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year or so before his May 2011 death, show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the CIA drone program that was killing many of the group's leaders in Pakistan's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. As a result of this pressure, al Qaeda officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as Afghanistan or Iran. They also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the Pakistani government had any clue about bin Laden's location or presence in Pakistan. CIA efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in June 2010 an al Qaeda official urged bin Laden, \"You should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period. Make the period between contacts longer and further apart. Take excessive caution and care, especially this year.\" This was wise counsel. Within a few weeks of this letter being written, the CIA would track bin Laden's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 1, 2011, a U.S. Navy SEAL operation ordered by President Barack Obama killed al Qaeda's leader. The new al Qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the SEALs recovered at bin Laden's compound. Several were released during the Brooklyn trial last month of al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer. Seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of bin Laden's death. It's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world, just as ISIS does today. The documents show how al Qaeda's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it, including the CIA drone program, that it had to hide in the shadows and couldn't pull off any successful operation in the West for many years before the death of bin Laden. The documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al Qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against Western targets. In a report on \"external operations,\" an al Qaeda official explained that a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Russia had fizzled and that despite sending al Qaeda members to the UK to hit \"several targets\" these operations had also come to nothing. Al Qaeda had also sent \"three brothers\" on a terrorist mission to Denmark, a country that bin Laden loathed because of the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but had \"lost contact with them.\" Given all the problems the group was having, an al Qaeda strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the \"simplest things such as  household knives, gas tanks, fuel, diesel and others like airplanes, trains and cars as  killing tools.\" 2011: U.S. offers details about bin Laden raid . A major theme of the documents is how much punishment the CIA drone program was inflicting on al Qaeda. Al Qaeda officials considered moving to Nuristan, a remote mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, or to other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh or Balochistan and even to Iran, which had been a key sanctuary for a number of al Qaeda's leaders after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001. Al Qaeda mulled opening an office in Iran, but \"we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations.\" In a letter to bin Laden, an al Qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of Mustafa Yazid, then the No. 3 leader of the group, on the night of May 22, 2010. The al Qaeda official wrote that Yazid was staying at the house of a \"well-known\" supporter of al Qaeda when a drone started making \"distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced. They all know that if a plane starts doing these turns, it is going to strike.\" Yazid and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike, according to the official. The official lamented that drones are \"still circling our skies every day\" and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover. The official wrote but \"then they come back when the sky is clear.\" Al Qaeda had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones \"but no result so far,\" according to the al Qaeda official. Underlining al Qaeda's weakness, during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the Pakistani government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al Qaeda's battle was \"primarily against the Americans. You became part of the battle when you sided with the Americans. If you were to leave us and our affairs alone, we would leave you alone.\" Highlights of bin Laden documents released in 2012 . The documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al Qaeda and the Pakistanis. At one point an al Qaeda official referred to \"bin Laden's call to jihad against the apostate government of Pakistan.\" Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda. According to the documents, Pakistani intelligence officials \"reached out to\" al Qaeda through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the Haqqani Taliban faction that have contacts with the ISI. The documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions, and there is no evidence in them that the Pakistanis had any idea that bin Laden was in Pakistan or indeed was even alive. Bergen in 2013: Bin Laden's life on the run . Moreover during the course of reporting the book \"Manhunt,\" about the CIA's long search for bin Laden, I spoke to several senior U.S. officials who said that the U.S. intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and ISI director Ahmed Shuja Pasha the night of the bin Laden raid and they were both surprised about him being in Abbottabad. The documents did show one area of real success for al Qaeda, which was kidnapping for ransom, a tactic ISIS has been using so effectively. In 2008, al Qaeda had captured Afghanistan's former ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Khaliq Farahi. After two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $5 million. An al Qaeda official told bin Laden that some of this money would be a \"gift\" to him \"from all the brothers.\" Bin Laden cautioned al Qaeda's leaders to be careful with the ransom money, as it might have to last the terrorist group several years. The documents show that al Qaeda's leaders were in contact with Tayeb Agha, a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Agha has met with U.S. officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations. 2011: How U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden . Far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed, the documents portray bin Laden as a hands-on manager of al Qaeda. In a 10-page letter that bin Laden wrote in August 2010, he had reams of advice for the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, ordering that the group not attack Sufi Muslims in Somalia and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the President of neighboring Uganda who had sent his troops to fight Al-Shabaab. Bin Laden gave detailed notes about how Al-Shabaab could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation, and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from Indonesia. He also advised Al-Shabaab against cutting down too many trees because it is \"dangerous for the environment of the region.\" Bin Laden had lived in nearby Sudan in the mid-'90s, establishing a number of business and farming enterprises. Bin Laden, something of a micromanager, told his top lieutenant to \"send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions.\" He also cautioned against sending any emails, including even encrypted ones, urging that hand-delivered letters were the only safe method of communication. Bergen on 2012 documents: Seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager . Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand \"the enemy's policies in the region.\" And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past, so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Bin Laden said he didn't want Zaidan to interview any members of his family, but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter \"promptly\" to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer. Bin Laden was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As the new al Qaeda documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the West was just that: a dream. And the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the CIA drone program.

Like the rodent he keeps as a pet, Pavel has grown accustomed to a subterranean existence after nine months living in a basement where he eats, sleeps and plays. Accompanied by his family and a group of others who have seen their city descend into a war zone, the young boy takes refuge from the ever-present threat of stray bullets and artillery fire. Waiting for lunch: Pavel Makeev, age 5, peeks his head through a doorway while waiting for his lunch to be cooked in Donetsk, Ukraine . Pavel and his family live in the basement of the cultural centre in Petrovskiy, an area of Donetsk  under pro-Russian rebel control, and the city above him has seen months of heavy and terrifying clashes between Ukrainian troops and rebels. Since the February 15 ceasefire, fighting may have eased but it has  not stopped altogether. The thump of artillery fire and the rattle of automatic guns still echo through a bleak landscape of fallen trees and splintered houses. Going home is still not a safe option. Life in the basement is simple, but with working electricity, the family have light and are able to use stoves to cook. A shabby collection of furniture and materials salvaged from buildings above decorates their underground home. Much of the natural light that the few windows allow in is blocked by protective sandbags. The desperate family are just a few of the thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - which began in April 2014 after Kiev sent its military to the southeastern regions that refused to recognize the new authorities in the capital. Nearly a year of fighting has led to at least 5,793 deaths, according to UN estimates. Another 14,595 people have been wounded in the conflict.

{"question": "(CNN)She married a man whose first wife mysteriously disappeared. And she stood by him even after he admitted killing a neighbor and chopping up the body. But who is Debrah Lee Charatan, the wife of millionaire heir Robert Durst? And what role has she played in his life? Charatan hasn't spoken publicly since her husband's arrest in New Orleans over the weekend, and CNN was unable to reach her for comment. In \"The Jinx,\" the HBO documentary about Durst's life, she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago. The series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between Durst and Charatan. Charatan says she met Durst in 1988, six years after his first wife went missing. The two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before Durst's longtime friend Susan Berman turned up dead in Beverly Hills, California. This week, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged Durst with first-degree murder in that case. It's an accusation he has long denied. He also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife's disappearance. In a 2003 trial, he admitted he'd shot a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, and dismembered the body, but was acquitted of murder after arguing he'd acted in self defense. Recorded jailhouse calls from Durst's imprisonment during that case suggest that Charatan was his rock. \"Am I supposed to be smiling or am I supposed to be grim?\" Durst asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial. Charatan quickly replies, \"I would just have as close to no expression, yeah, that's what I think.\" She was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney Michael Kennedy, a lawyer Durst's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case. The insanity defense Kennedy was planning to use, she said at the time, could have meant both Durst and Charatan were cut out of the family fortune. \"What he doesn't want is me to get any of the trust money later on, since I'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time, OK, that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions,\" she says in another call. Like Durst himself, Charatan is a powerful player on the New York real estate scene. \"She's not some opportunistic woman who came into Bob's life for monetary gain. She was very successful, a millionaire several times over long before she met Bob,\" said Amir Korangy, publisher of TheRealDeal.com. Susan Criss, the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial, said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it's clear that Charatan is motivated by financial gain. \"It's very clear that she only cares about the money,\" Criss said. Some former friends and employees described Charatan in less than glowing terms. Former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions. According to sources, she only briefly lived with Durst and they are now separated, though still married. Why doesn't the HBO documentary feature any more recent interviews with her? Charatan didn't want Durst to participate in \"The Jinx,\" Korangy said, and she hasn't spoken with him since it started airing. CNN's Catherine E.

Patrick Kennedy told The Associated Press after visiting Jackson behind bars. Kennedy said he spoke with Jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 ½-year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items. The expenditures included fur capes, lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before Election Day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of federal crimes in a scheme that involved spending mroe than $750,000 of his campaign money on more than 3,000 personal items . BIG HOUSE: Jackson sered his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina – the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 and were present for their son's sentencing . Jackson began the sentence on Nov. 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as Sept. 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods – including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, \"I'm leaving Thursday morning\",' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. SUMPTUOUS: Jackson's Washington, DC house got a decorator's touch, courtesy of his campaign donors . Among the items auctioned by the US Marshals Service was this framed and autographed cymbal from Michael Jackson's last concert tour . Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.", "answer": ["Former congressman pleaded guilty in 2013 to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife – buying more than 3,000 items .\nSentenced to 30 months but will move to a halfway house tomorrow after serving barely half of that behind bars .\nAnother former Democratic congressman visited him in prison and learned about the impending move .\nJackson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before his downward spiral .\nHis father is the civil rights activist and preacher Rev.

{"question": "The former ACT chief minister has revealed a long-term, exhausting battle with anorexia, which saw her weight dwindle to a mere 30 kilograms. The 59-year-old has announced her teenage struggles at a function on Monday and has shared that she still has to have little discussions with herself about body image and naturally thinks she is too fat. Now the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Carnell has recalled beginning to lose weight at 12 or 13 years old when a teenage interest in boys and fashion sparked. The head of the Australia Chamber of Commerce announced her continuing struggles at a function on Monday . She said she felt rotten about herself and what she was doing to others in her life. 'I was stick thin but people said 'wow you are looking so great.' I wasn't - I was looking really skinny,' she told ABC television. 'It is hard to understand why you can't put a piece of food in your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. How hard can that be. When you've got anorexia it's like moving a mountain,' she said. The ABC reported that Ms Carnell was in and out of hospitals in her home town of Brisbane during the 1960s and 70s and was lying to her parents about what she was eating and the amount of exercise she was doing. The battle with anorexia began when she was 12 or 13 and she gained an interest in boys and fashion . Her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms and saw her in and out of hospitals . When 15-years-old, she was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney when the situation became severe. 'For a 15-year-old away from home it was to say the least pretty scary,' she said. She said her parents were only allowed to visit occasionally and she was incredibly homesick. 'Imagine a scenario when you've got a teenage daughter who's always been a bit of an overachiever, pretty smart — and all of a sudden they're killing themselves in front of your eyes,' she said. Ms. Carnell outlined these experiences at a function where the advocacy group The Butterfly Foundation released a report that outlined the high cost of treating eating disorders that affected almost a million Australians. The chairman of the Butterfly Foundation, David Murray said their report from Deloitte focuses on the economic cost of the problem and the large benefits of intervention. 'Early intervention pays big time, with about a 50 per cent cost reduction for the government in the health system by getting the problem early enough,' he said. 'We have to adjust the system for early intervention which very quickly recognises this as a mental condition and brings in the right type of specialist support.'", "answer": ["The head of the ACCI outlined her struggles at a function on Monday .\nThrough her battle she has seen her weight dwindle to just 30 kilograms .\nAt 15 years old she was sent to a psychiatric facility in Sydney .\nChairman of The Butterfly Foundation has said intervention pays big time ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Some of us are not obvious cruisers. I have an irrational fear of death by drowning and can't bear the thought of eating three meals a day, every day. So the prospect of a 16-day voyage round New Zealand to Australia is alarming. Will I survive? Or will I disappear overboard, laden with food, the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster? New Zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains, fjords, forests, glaciers, and lakes, home to the dolphin, whale, penguin, albatross, seal and sea-lion (there is a difference: the latter eat the former for breakfast). A place to pause: The tiny port of Picton is a gateway to the winelands of New Zealand's Marborough region . Home, too, to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson-flowered pohutukawa, the New Zealand Christmas tree. And you can get oysters everywhere. It's a long journey to New Zealand, so make sure you find somewhere to recover. The Boatshed on Waiheke Island, a short ferry ride from Auckland, is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land. I'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a Harley Davidson - 1800cc of shiny, macho metal. 'Have you ridden an HD before?' asks my hunky 'chauffeur'. No, but I used to have a Lambretta 125. Coming back for more: A high percentage of people on the Seabourn Odyssey are returning passengers . 'Just lean when I lean,' he says. I cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed. My cruising worries begin to evaporate when I meet the crew of Seabourn Odyssey. 'Welcome home,' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words, until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees. In our ship-shape suite, everything is sparklingly clean (as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps, I notice these things). Captain Cook charted the coastline of New Zealand 245 years ago. As well as unpredictable seas, he feared scurvy, caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which leads to suppurating wounds, loss of teeth and ultimately death. No danger of that on the Odyssey. I can't think of another period in my life when I've eaten so well, so consistently. Cook pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut; I sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canapé. That night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep. Taken for a ride: Sue took a tour of Waiheke island in speedy two-wheeled style - on a Harley Davidson . The ship has 450 passengers, 11 decks, four restaurants, a spa, fitness centre, swimming pool, hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than Cook's ship. On day one, we disembark andhead for Rotorua and its strange geothermal pools. 'Tours4Matures' says a minibus sign — a reminder of the age profile. We hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud, hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters. But why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap can't reach? We get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing. Independence comes at a price. Crossing the Cook Strait to South Island, we anchor at the tiny port of Picton and take an excursion into the Marlborough High Country, to a remote sheep station where we meet Hailey Pitts. She and her husband Jeremy farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep. It's a hard life, but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it. As we cruise through Queen Charlotte Sound, said to be Captain Cook's favourite anchorage, peace envelops me. I sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us. What a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station. Idyllic: Waiheke island sits on Auckland's doorstep - but feels far removed from New Zealand's biggest city . Ah, well - what's for dinner? In Akaroa, we see Hector's dolphin, the smallest and rarest in the world. In Port Chalmers, we climb up to a memorial to Captain Robert Scott. He set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the South Pole. The sunset is spectacular that night and I think of Captain Scott and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears, leaving behind a trail of light, first pink, then orange, then burgundy, until finally blackness falls. (Trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite. Let's just say it was moving.) On south, until we hit the last land before the South Pole, the beautiful Stewart Island. Due west - nothing but sea until the tip of South America. Due east - ditto. It's time to turn and head out to Australia. It's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of New Zealand across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne. Gale force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves. My irrational fears return. The crossing takes three long days and nights, But I come to realise how a big ship like the Odyssey can cope with such seas. I relax into the camaraderie that develops on board, and at long last we're cruising into Melbourne and then along the coast to Sydney. Calm comforts: Picton is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the Cook Strait . At 6am on a beautiful summer's morning, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge welcome us to a city full of promise. That afternoon, I watch from my hotel window as the Seabourn Odyssey sets sail once more, back to Auckland. Now someone else is in suite 722. Someone else is being made to feel this is a voyage designed only for them. I confess to feeling proprietorial and not a little emotional. I must be a cruiser.

{"question": "(CNN)Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. \"In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. \"While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\"", "answer": ["A new study shows a 43% lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco-vegetarian diet .\nColorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the U.S.\nPlant-based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £1,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around £10,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least £6,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put £743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to £120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of £383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that £383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' £272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and £208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just £61.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged £896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some £4,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The £896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly £5,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

{"question": "Chile's president went to a hospital Saturday to meet with a 14-year-old girl who shocked the country by going on YouTube to plead for the leader to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis. The government quickly said no after the video began spreading on social media Thursday. A government statement said President Michelle Bachelet talked with Valentina Maureira and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in the capital. Scroll down for video . President Michelle Bachelet, right, poses for a selfie with Valentina Maureira, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, at a hospital in Santiago, Chile . Officials did not release any information on what was said. But the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Valentina taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Maureira, a 14-year girl who suffers cystic fibrosis and asked the Government for permission to die through a YouTube video, at the Clinic Hospital of Catholic University of Santiago de Chile . Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia. 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said. Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said. Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old . Valentina's father said she will continue trying to meet with Bachelet, so the president, who is also a pediatrician, can 'listen to her life story.' 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life. 'She's exhausted, we're all exhausted, but if she wants to keep fighting, I'll be by her side every second,' the father said.

{"question": "Host commentator . That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid £90million for Bale or £65m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it. Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters. They definitely won’t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad. Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata. I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game – that is something that is always missing from a Clasico. Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I’ve seen him recently. Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball. He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night. He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo’s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn’t see a great deal of the ball. He certainly didn’t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself. Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he’d played some part in – no Barcelona player has played in more. What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Barça vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He’ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it. Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying. So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don’t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you’ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome. Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest. He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch. You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though. I don’t think he’s very happy for several reasons. Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club’s supporters – he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called ‘fans’ have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning). He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year. CLICK HERE to read the full story as angry Madrid fan attacks Bale's car . Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid. Paul Clement would I’m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal – who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League – would have a coach who has won the competition three times. It all sounds perfect, I don’t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion! Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn’t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca. We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool don’t exactly play like Harry Basset’s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him. It’s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him. Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season. The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader’s performance. Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard. It’s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn’t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning ‘La Decima’ but he hasn’t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change. Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge. Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward. Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3. He put a decent shift in but if he’s working back he can’t also be on Jordi Alba’s shoulder waiting to pull away. This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities. He also faded last night because the team did – Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered. Pete Jenson: It’s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives. But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too. So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game. Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool. In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal. At Barcelona he’s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind. I’m not sure he’ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season – but he will score more important ones.

{"question": "(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice.

{"question": "Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators £3,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'", "answer": ["Teacher Kim Davies made more than 20 complaints against a colleague .\nShe lodged a further nine complaints with an exam board .\nMs Davies faced a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct .\nThe teacher was followed by private detectives after taking sick leave .\nCaerphilly Council thought Ms Davies was trying to defraud the system .\nMs Davies was reprimanded by a watchdog for breaking a number of rules .\nShe was also criticised for making several vexatious complaints .\nMs Davies avoided a classroom ban following the watchdog's hearing .\nShe said she now wanted to get back into the classroom and teach ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station completed a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet, NASA reported. In a tweet, the space agency said astronaut Terry Virts experienced water inside his helmet, just as he did Wednesday, but \"it's a known issue; no concern.\" The spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes, NASA said. \"Crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks,\" the agency said in a release. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of \"sublimator water carryover.\" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had \"a high degree of confidence\" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water, and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it. She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as \"wet and cold.\" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.  NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space.", "answer": ["Spacewalk last more than five hours; crews have spent more than 1,171 hours spacewalking .\nAstronaut Terry Virts found a small amount of water inside his helmet ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A London woman is embroiled in a fight for compensation with Jet Airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight-hour flight. Passengers, including two families with infant children, were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London. Traveller Amrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows, and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor. Photos show water trickling into the aisle (left) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess (right) The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: ‘After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats. ‘We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating. ‘He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.’ She added: ‘It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as … the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.’ Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks. Passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin . In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener. Amrita said: ‘This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack. ‘After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.’ Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well. Passengers were forced to endure the stench for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London . She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology. She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways’ frequent flyer club. She wasn’t satisfied with the offer, saying: ‘Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience. A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Jet Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to guests on board flight 9W122 DEL - LHR dt.,Feb 15, 2015, on account of reverse drainage from the sinks on board the aircraft. 'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.' Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks . Ms Jaurre said: ‘Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin. ‘I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.’ She added: ‘I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.’ She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket. ‘Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.’", "answer": ["Passengers, including infant children, endured the pungent smell for hours .\nAmrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows .\nCabin crew tried to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor .\nPassengers used articles of clothing to try to mask the foul odour .\nMs Jaurre, 27, said she suffered a headache and became nauseous ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A striking set of twins, who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed-race parentage, have revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, both 18, said classmates at school thought they were telling fibs when they revealed they were twins. Lucy and Maria's mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin. Lucy (left) and Maria (right) Aylmer, both 18, have faced questions from curious strangers throughout their lives over their radically different looks. Lucy even uploaded a photo of her birth certificate to Facebook . The twins say it isn't just their looks that are different, they have individual personalities too. Lucy (far left) says she's much more shy than her sister Maria (second left), despite being born 23 seconds before her . Speaking to Ben Shepherd and Susanna Reid, the twins, from Gloucester, opened up about how their distinctively different looks had often made life difficult at school. Red-haired Lucy said her pale complexion had prompted speculation that she'd been adopted: 'My classmates used to ask if I was adopted because my siblings are all quite dark. 'It was pretty hard, it went on in secondary school and it wasn't very nice.' When the girls were first born in 1997, their mother Donna had no idea that she could give birth to such different looking twins, described by experts as a one-in-a-million chance. Growing up, the girls said they regularly overheard people asking their mum 'Which one is yours?' or 'Are you the childminder?'. Although most of their friends now know their unique story, they still have to present new acquaintances with photos of their birth certificates to prove they really are twin sisters. 'Our friends do believe us now because we make a big fuss,' says Maria. 'We've got birth certificates. Lucy even had a picture of hers on her Facebook [profile].' As the girls have turned into grown-ups they've tried to find their own style. Lucy, who has naturally curly hair, straightens it to ensure a sleek look. And the twins stopped wearing the same outfits when they were seven. Lucy says: 'I think I said to my mum: \"I don't want to wear the same clothes as Maria any more\".' Same same, but different:  Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . When asked at what age the girls knew their situation might raise questions from others, they say it took them a long time to know that their family was anything but ordinary. 'It is what it is,' says Maria. 'We never even picked up on it until friends started talking about it at school.' Their mother, who is 47 and a warehouse worker, and their 53-year-old father, who works as a scaffolder, split up after the twins were born. The 18-year-olds have three older siblings, George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21. Lucy told the Daily Mail: ‘Our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween Maria and I. We are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween. ‘But my grandmother has a very fair English rose complexion, just like mine.’ She added: ‘No one ever believes we are twins. Even when we dress alike, we still don’t look like sisters, let alone twins.’ Family line: The twins' mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and their siblings George, Chynna and Jordan all have darker skin than Lucy and lighter than Maria . Two of a kind: The twins, who live in Gloucester, were born in January 1997 . Different strokes:  'Outgoing' Maria studies law at Cheltenham College, while 'shy' Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College . All together: Maria and Lucy with their mother Donna and siblings George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21 . Non-identical twins come from separate eggs, so inherit different genes. The girls’ half-Jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin. By chance, Lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and Maria will have genes that code for black skin. People with Afro-Caribbean heritage often have some European DNA, dating back in many cases to the slave trade. This increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin. Lucy said of her time at school: ‘We were in the same class, but no one had a problem telling us apart. Twins are known for swapping identities. But there was no way Maria and I could ever do anything like that. ‘Most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we couldn’t look more different if we tried. We don’t look like we have the same parents, let alone having been born at the same time.’ The twins’ interests are as different as their looks. Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College whilst Maria studies law at Cheltenham College. Lucy explained: ‘Maria was outgoing whilst I was the shy one. But Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and I’m very proud of having a black twin.’", "answer": ["Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins .\nGrowing up,  mother Donna would be asked if she was their 'childminder'\nDonna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white .\nTwins say they have radically different styles ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Grayson Perry's unusual Gingerbread House holiday home has been branded an 'abomination' by local villagers inundated with art fans flocking to see the property. The Turner Prize-winning artist teamed up with the organisation Living Architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of Wrabness. But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video . The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie' The quirky cottage was supposed to 'explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex' and is expected to open for holiday bookings in the spring. But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity. 'We're not a snotty London art gallery, yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded 'Gingerbread House'. 'I can only imagine how bad it will be in the summer. 'I still do not understand how this abomination got planning permission in the first place?' Wrabness Parish Council strongly objected to the proposal to knock down the existing farmhouse and replace it with the imposing structure that combines sculptures, tapestries and ceramics. Villagers in Wrabness have said that Grayson Perry's 'Gingerbread house' has caused traffic chaos . The Turner Prize-winning artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics, and right, the house in honour to a mythical Essex woman called 'Julie' The original plans for the home were turned down by Tendring District Council but a re-submitted application for the wacky home was given the green-light by planners. The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie'. Perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst ‘doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television’. The house is located on the banks of the River Stour, in the rural village of Wrabness . He wanted it to resemble a ‘jewel box’ that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called Julie, who had a difficult childhood, love life, divorce and late career. Hence, there’s an 8ft statue of her on the roof, naked and pregnant, and her name is emblazoned all over the walls. Essex County Council Highways Authority have now agreed to redesign tiny local roads to improve access to the site.

{"question": "Former England captain Lewis Moody says he does not think England will win the World Cup this year. Moody, who won 71 caps over a 10-year career, believes Stuart Lancaster's team are 'not quite where they need to be' to lift the William Webb Ellis cup on October 31. The former Leicester and Bath flanker, speaking at an awards ceremony for the Prince's Trust in London, told the Press Association: 'I don't think England are in the right place at the moment to win the World Cup. Former England captain Lewis Moody does not think England are in a position to win the World Cup . Moody knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in 2003 . 'If they can get through the pool stages they'll have a great, fighting chance. Being at home for every match makes a massive difference and if you get into a semi-final anything could happen - but I think at the minute they are probably not quite where they need to be to win the World Cup. 'They can certainly be there to push the others, and if they get into the semi-final then there is every chance they could make the final.' Moody, who cannot see beyond New Zealand as tournament winners, believes Lancaster may be hoping his squad will peak for 2019. He continued: 'He's been building a team, there are a lot of young new changes coming, so I think he'll be focusing on the next World Cup, especially as he's had that nice new contract extension.' However, he believes England can still win the Six Nations. Lancaster oversee training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham . Moody said: 'It is disappointing that England have ended up in this position. They had a good chance to come away with a Grand Slam but they have got to focus on Scotland now. 'It should be a reasonably comfortable result against Scotland, and then go on and beat France. They can still win it, but it will be a big ask now - we are reliant on other teams.' Moody added: 'I am a huge fan of Stuart Lancaster. 'I think he's done terribly well and I think all that now Stuart is lacking is that win, that result that really says, 'Look, what I've been doing over the last four years has been about this, achieving this', and if we can take something out of the Six Nations, which will be tough now, then he'll have that.' One bonus is that the Six Nations may well have ironed out England's conundrum at fly-half and in the centres, Moody suggested, with George Ford and Jonathan Joseph cementing their places. He said: 'For me it is quite simple. I think Ford has stepped up and done a fantastic job. I'd keep him there, and he would be my man for the World Cup.

Ford offloads a pass during training as England prepare for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland . 'Joseph has stepped in and filled a void I think we've been nursing since Will Greenwood was playing, and that's some time ago now. 'And when Manu Tuilagi comes back I'd like to see Joseph and Tuilagi playing in the centres together and how they can work that. I think (Luther) Burrell has been all right but I think Joseph and Tuilagi are probably the future.' Moody was adamant Ford's rise had not consigned Farrell's days as England's starting number 10 to history. 'They are certainly not over,' he said. 'The fact George has come in and done so well, George Ford has had a fantastic start to his international career. 'Owen is a young man in his own right.

{"question": "The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday . Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system . Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench . Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder – was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool’s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool’s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea’s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool’s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville’s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson’s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection . But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea’s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side’s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does. VIDEO Monk rues missed chances . Mamadou Sahko (right) puts in a challenge on Jonjo Shelvey as he again impressed for Liverpool . Martin Skrtel (left) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved Liverpool defence . Yes, the defenders look more assured. Yes, Skrtel is proving himself a leader in the Liverpool defence. Against Swansea he was outstanding, even producing the initial pass that led to Henderson’s goal. And yes, Sakho and Can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of Liverpool defenders. But they are working as a team, and playing with more composure after Rodgers realised the more cavalier approach they employed when Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were terrorising defenders just wasn’t working this season. The statistics make interesting reading. Only five Premier League goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year. But it’s as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of Rodgers. And while the deployment of Gerrard as a holding midfielder, and with it a slight change to a diamond formation, gave Henderson the freedom to get further forward last night, it was the mere fact that Henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of Sturridge’s flick-on that earned Liverpool their goal.

{"question": "The off-duty New Jersey police officer who was behind the wheel during a wrong-way crash that killed two on Staten Island last week had eight previous accidents and a DUI on his record. Linden Officer Pedro Abad Jr. killed Officer Frank Viggiano and friend Joe Rodriguez - both 28 - when he drove the wrong way after a night at a  strip club and collided head-on with a tractor-trailer. Abad had his license suspended for seven months starting in October 2013 after an alcohol-related accident in Rahway, New Jersey, in February of that year. Scroll down for video . Pedro Abad Jr. (pictured both) had eight accidents and a DUI on his record before the Staten Island crash . Abad was driving four people including himself when he crashed into the truck on Staten Island on March 20 . Off-duty officer Frank Viggiano, 28 (left), was in the rear right seat and died in the crash. Patrik Kudlac, 23 (right), is now in a critical condition. He was also off duty at the time. His license was taken after a a judge found Abad refused to submit to a chemical test and was driving under the influence. Before that crash, Abad had been involved in six accidents dating back to 2005, the New York Daily News reported. He was reportedly involved in another accident, his eighth, four months after the Rahway incident. It is unclear if he was determined to be at fault in the accidents. The fatal crash on the West Shore Expressway on March 20 on State Island was his ninth accident. Abad's license was restored in March 2014, but he had to use an ignition lock until September 2014, according to New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission spokeswoman Elyse Coffey. The 27-year-old cop, who was hired as a police officer in 2008, was on the force at the time of the suspension. Abad and 23-year-old Officer Patrik Kudlac were in critical but stable condition after the crash. Abad (left) posted a photo of three whiskey shots (right) to his Instagram  just hours before the deadly crash . Abad's car was traveling in the wrong direction on the southbound West Shore Expressway at about 5am . The crash occurred after the three off-duty New Jersey cops and their friend left this Staten Island strip club . The truck driver suffered injuries that are not considered life-threatening. Hours before the crash, Abad had posted a photo on his Instagram page of three shot glasses filled with what he identified as 'Jack Daniels Fire on the house.'

{"question": "Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken out against two new laws in Indiana and Arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on 'religious liberty'. Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' He said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Scroll down for video . Marching: Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to hold a rally against the new law, which forbids the government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs . As well as opposing the Indiana law, in a tweet he called for Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill, HB1228, which has passed through the senate and is waiting to be rubber-stamped by the Republican. HB1228 is also named the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and uses the same wording as the Indiana legislation. The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff also announced on Twitter that he would no longer send employees or customers to Indiana. Proud: Cook said that, being born a Baptist, he supported religion, but added: 'I was never taught that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate' (Cook pictured centre at gay pride parade in San Francisco) Making a statement: Cook previously expressed opposition to the new laws in Indiana and Arkansas on his Twitter page . Cook's op-ed came after thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.' Pence said there was a 'tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding' surrounding the legislation, forms of which are already enshrined in law in 20 other states. Pence told the Indy Star he will support legislation to 'clarify' the controversial law, and expects it to go before the General Assembly this week. While he did not discuss the wording of the new bill, he has previously said the intention of the law is to block government intervention in matters of conscience, rather than allowing people to discriminate against others.", "answer": ["Tim Cook, 54, condemned religious freedom law in Indiana and Arkansas .\nApple CEO said bills 'rationalize injustice' by pretending to defend religion .\nThey will take U.S. back to days of 'Whites Only' signs in stores, he said .\nLaw forbids government from 'substantially burdening' religious beliefs ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson has denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, has provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse for two days . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. Ian Paterson said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues through Wednesday. Purple ribbons were tied out the front of Knox Grammar School in honour of victims of paedophile teachers . Dr Paterson read out a statement apologising for his failings at the beginning of the commission's hearing in Sydney today .

{"question": "Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes English football does not have enough black managers and coaches – and wants the ‘jobs for the boys’ culture out of the game. Palace face Queens Park Rangers in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off at Selhurst Park and their manager Chris Ramsey is the only ethnic minority boss in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew wants clubs to work on encouraging ethnic minority coaches to reflect the huge variety of cultures that players in England come from, rather than employing the same “boys club” members. Palace manager Alan Pardew believes that English football isn't doing enough to include black coaches . Chris Ramsey, QPR boss, is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the Football League . Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton’s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion. ‘He (Ramsey) is black, which I think is great for the Premier League,’ Pardew said. ‘It’s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn’t right.’ Palace employ just ‘three or four’ black coaches, according to Pardew and in future recruitment he plans to change that, while backing the idea of a ‘Rooney Rule’ as seen in American Football where a black coach is considered for every job. ‘I’m going to keep approaching when vacancies come up and make sure that we are covering every kind of opportunity in terms of applications that come in,’ he said. ‘It isn’t “jobs for the boys” here anymore, I’m not saying it was, but sometimes it does go like that.

Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is currently managing League Two outfit Burton Albion . ‘I think something like that (the Rooney Rule) could be looked at. I also know the LMA and the PFA are really trying to encourage a more diverse approach to getting different creeds to come into the coaching world and I just want to take this opportunity to back that up. Pardew also looked to push forward the prospects of more Asian footballers coming into the game after signing South Korean winger Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers in the January transfer window. And Pardew says Palace, based in the ethnically diverse area of South Norwood outside London, owe it to their surroundings to be more culturally diverse. ‘I don’t want to talk just about Afro-Caribbean coaches either,’ he said. ‘We have an Asian player now in our first team. We don’t have a lot of that and that’s another area that we need to promote, Asian footballers in this area because there’s a lot of huge community here. ‘We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportions make sense.’ Crystal Palace signed Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers during the January transfer window .", "answer": ["Alan Pardew believes there should be more non-white managers .\nThe Eagles boss is keen to see the Rooney Rule introduced into football .\nThe Rooney Rule ensures a black coach is interviewed when vacancy occurs in American Football .\nCrystal Palace take on Chris Ramsey's QPR on Saturday afternoon ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "London (CNN)The handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip:  makeup, bras, underwear, boots, an epilator. But this list was apparently made by the three UK schoolgirls suspected of traveling from London to Syria to join ISIS, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which has seen the document. The girls' families told British lawmakers Tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning, and said they were baffled by the teenagers' decision to leave their homes and families. The three East London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. They are thought to have crossed the Turkish border into Syria within days. Relatives also had harsh words for police, who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to Syria in December. Amira Abase's father, Hussen Abase, told lawmakers at a hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized. Sahima Begum, the older sister of Shamima Begum, said her sister had been into \"normal teenage things,\" like watching \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" reading and playing games on her phone. There was nothing to indicate she was radicalized, she said. Fahmida Aziz, first cousin of Kadiza Sultana, said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization, \"we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying\" that thinking. She also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said it was \"every parent's nightmare that this should happen\" and said he could only imagine the families' distress and anguish. Who are the missing UK girls? The families' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a February 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents, rather than being sent directly to the parents. The families claim they were not told about a 15-year-old friend of the girls going to Syria weeks earlier -- and say that had they known, they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too. Metropolitan Police Chief Bernard Hogan-Howe apologized for his officers' failure to get the letter directly to the parents, in his testimony before the committee. But he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left, with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit. Hogan-Howe said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told the committee there was a \"steady flow\" of girls trying to travel to Syria, perhaps one or two a month. He said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to Turkey at a local travel agency, using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families. None of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for Istanbul. However, the families' lawyer asked how they had managed, as minors, to board the flight without being challenged. CCTV footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of Istanbul -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether UK police had communicated effectively with Turkish authorities. Rowley said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing, who has not been named. Asked how the UK might be able to get the girls back, Rowley cited an incentive: As long as they're not connected to terrorist offenses, they'll be able to return to their families. Rowley said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism-related activities, and if that remained the case, they wouldn't be treated as terrorists upon their return. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? The list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing. It detailed items to buy, such as underwear, a mobile phone and cosmetics, and estimated travel costs, apparently totaling £2,190 ($3,296). The biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to Turkey, the newspaper said, at just over £1,000. The list, written on a page from a diary planner, had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for. It's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs. Over the weekend, the girls' families asked for an apology from London's Metropolitan Police over the force's handling of the case. The police said in a statement Saturday that after the first girl went missing in December, a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at Bethnal Green Academy -- including Shamima, Kadiza, and Amira -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl. A deputy principal at the girls' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls, on the advice of police, and told them that the girls' friend, referred to only as \"Girl 1,\" had been reported missing. An officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on February 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters, the police statement said. But not all the letters were passed on. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents,\" the police statement said. \"However, the parents were already aware from the Deputy Head that Girl 1 had been reported missing, all the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria.\" What is ISIS' appeal for young people? Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis, as she did. Her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter, which recommends that those traveling to Syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much, since they may need to move often and at short notice, while remaining inconspicuous.

{"question": "A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger . 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a \"girlfriend experience\" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' – which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it – has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles. They are hoping to prove that Lord Morrow's law contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, including the rights to privacy, health and protection from degrading treatment. The law may even flout the human right to life. If prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous, Laura has no doubt that deaths will follow. 'Sex workers are going to suffer,' she said. 'I witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when I was working in Dublin. As soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit, violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it wasn't too long before [21-year-old sex worker] Sinead Kelly was stabbed to death by a client.' Last year, a similar law was proposed in the UK by MP Fiona Mactaggart. But after a campaign by the English collective of Prostitutes (ECP), the Sex Worker Open University and the Women's Institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote. Laura Watson of the ECP said they are behind Laura Lee's fight in Northern Ireland. 'Internationally, sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger,' she said. 'Legal challenges, spearheaded by sex workers, are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection.'", "answer": ["Laura Lee, 37, travels between Scotland and Ireland as a sex worker .\nIt means that from June 1, men who pay for sex could be arrested .\nThe mother believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony believes the champions now have to target victory in every remaining game to retain their title. City remain five points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea after slipping to a 2-1 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday. The London side also have a game in hand and City have just 11 matches left to turn the situation around. Wilfried Bony says Manchester City can still retain the Premier League if they win all their remaining games . Bony has only made appearances from the bench so far for City, and was booked in the defeat by Liverpool . Bony said: 'It is disappointing, we have made it difficult for ourselves now.

In between Henderson and Coutinho's strikes Edin Dzeko equalised, but City were well beaten . Bony did not feature for a month after the move was completed due to his involvement in Ivory Coast's African Nations Cup win and has had to make do with coming off the bench since. His 78th-minute introduction at Anfield came with his side already 2-1 down and he was unable to affect the outcome. His only notable contribution to the game came when he was booked for an aerial challenge on Adam Lallana that arguably could have been worth a red card. City had cancelled out Jordan Henderson's superb early strike with a well-worked Edin Dzeko equaliser but the outstanding Philippe Coutinho restored the hosts' lead with a 75th-minute stunner.

{"question": "(CNN)Real Madrid's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front. Sunday's 6-1 demolition of Rayo Vallecano put the Catalan side one point above Real at the top of Spain's La Liga, with Lionel Messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward Luis Suarez also scored twice. Even without suspended Brazil star Neymar -- the third prong of Barca's striking line -- Enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in Madrid wounds following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao. \"We're elated, but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season. I already said that everybody could lose a game, so we have to keep playing well and win every match,\" he said. \"It's heavy having to win every single match. Each game is more important than the last.\" By contrast, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against Villarreal. \"There is no link-up play, our play is too based around individual play, we need another way of attacking, with faster play and fewer touches,\" said the Italian, who must rouse his troops for Tuesday's European Champions League last-16, second-leg tie at home to Schalke. \"It is quite confusing to see what we're doing at the moment in attack. The ball doesn't move around quickly.\" While Real's front trio of top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season, Barca's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams' \"El Clasico\" clash at the Nou Camp in a fortnight. Messi's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a Spanish club player, and took him past Ronaldo as the La Liga leader on 24 trebles. The Argentina star also drew level with the Portugal captain as the Spanish league's top scorer this season on 30 goals. It's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals, with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign. Suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games, and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from English club Liverpool after a World Cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. \"Suarez and Messi are having more and more chemistry, and today we all saw what they bring to the team,\" Enrique said. \"I like (Ivan) Rakitic wherever he plays on the field. He always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we've ever had.\" \"(Gerard) Piqué has always known how to score, above all on set plays. It's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively.\" Both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000, Barca's best this season: Rayo defender Tito for a foul on Suarez in the 55th minute that allowed Messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty; and Dani Alves for tripping Alberto Bueno, who also netted the resulting spot-kick. Barca's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid after the defending champion's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed Valencia later Sunday. Koke put Atletico ahead in the first half but Shkodran Mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left, while Valencia teammate Javi Fuego received two late yellow cards. Sixth-placed Villarreal beat Celta Vigo 4-0, while Real Sociedad beat Espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash. In Italy, second-placed Roma missed a chance to put pressure on leader Juventus after being held 0-0 at struggling Chievo Verona on Sunday. It left Rudi Garcia's team eight points adrift of Juve, which hosts Sassuolo on Monday. Third-placed Napoli also drew, blowing a two-goal lead against Inter Milan as Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi, with an 87th-minute penalty, canceled out second-half goals by Marek Hamsik and Gonzalo Higuain. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fourth with a 3-0 win at Paderborn as South Korea striker Heung-Min Son scored two late goals after a 73rd-minute opener from Greece defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos. In France, Lyon restored a one-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win at Montpellier, as young midfielder Nabil Fekir scored twice.

{"question": "Winston Churchill planned to tempt America into joining World War Two by offering the country a priceless copy of the Magna Carta. The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through. Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value. Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution. In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift . In an attempt to win them over, the British Cabinet, supported by Churchill, planned to gift them the copy of the Magna Carta, which belonged to Lincoln Cathedral. The letters, reported in The Independent, say: 'A friendly act, graciously performed, evokes a tremendous response; when an American has his emotions stirred, his generosity is unbounded. 'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.' Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

{"question": "Sepp Blatter celebrated his 79th birthday on Tuesday as one of his rivals for the FIFA presidency obtained some high-level support for his bid to be the most powerful person in world football. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has secured statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family. Although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on May 29 there is a history, particularly in Arab countries, of the ruling family influencing football policy. FIFA Vice President Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is in the running to become the next president of FIFA . The Prince sits alongside UEFA President Michel Platini during a CONMEBOL congress on March 4 . That could be important to Prince Ali who has struggled to win support in his own Asian football confederation (AFC) - only one AFC country, his home country Jordan, nominated him to stand. It is by no means certain however that the Bahrain FA will back Prince Ali despite the King offering his support. AFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is also from Bahrain and has already given his backing to Blatter. Furthermore, the leading powerbroker in Olympic sport Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah from Kuwait is also supporting Blatter. Ali bin al-Hussein has received backing from high profile supporters, including the King of Bahrain (above), . Sheikh Ahmad wields significant influence, especially in Asia as head of the Olympic Council of Asia, and is himself standing for the FIFA executive committee at the end of April. Prince Ali is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing, and also to have taken heart from last week's congress of the South American confederation CONMEBOL, where no formal vote to back Blatter was taken. A report from Jordan's government new agency stated: 'His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalif of Bahrain, on Monday, received HRH Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein accompanied by Interior Minister Hussein Majali, and stressed Bahrain's support to Prince Ali's bid for FIFA presidency.'

Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race . Last week van Praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from Europe. He also claimed Figo's plans for funding national associations would 'bankrupt FIFA'. Meanwhile, Germany's outgoing FIFA member Theo Zwanziger has reiterated his belief that the 2022 World Cup should be removed from Qatar if the Garcia report into bidding for the tournament flags up rule breaches. Zwanziger told Bayern 2 radio station: 'The best solution would be not to play in Qatar and to rectify this wrong decision.

{"question": "Sharron O'Neill always knew she had something. Even before she was diagnosed with cancer as a teenager, she knew her family had a stronger link to the deadly disease than others. When Ms O'Neill was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in her late 20s, a genetic condition that makes someone more likely to get cancer, she said it wasn't surprise. Sharron O'Neil and her mother, Jilian Carter, both have Lynch syndrome. It is a genetic condition that makes someone 85 per cent more likely to get cancer . 'Our family always knew there was something; we just didn't know it was a gene and a specific thing,' Ms O'Neill said. 'But, once I found out about Lynch syndrome and knew what it was, it all started to make sense.' Mrs O'Neill was diagnosed with bowel cancer when she was just 19. A week earlier, her grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer. Her mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 39. Her family history with cancer extends back much further, with Ms O'Neill saying she tracked it back more than 200 years. 'The farthest back I have been able to go is to a relative who came to Australia on a boat as an orphan in the early 1800s,' she said. 'It covers six generations that I know of.' Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to a number of cancers including bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer, among many others. People with the gene have an 85 per cent chance of developing cancer before the age of 70. Ms O'Neill's great-grandmother died of cancer. Just five years later, her grandmother's sister did too. She said the family was 'on notice' from that point. In the following years, four of the five remaining children, including Ms O'Neill's grandmother,  faced three of more Lynch syndrome cancers, averaging out to almost one person per decade. Family ties: Mrs O'Neil's grandmother in the arms of her great grandmother . Lynch Syndrome Australia spokeswoman Beth Fairbank said approximately 20,000 Australians have the genetic condition, but only five per cent of people were diagnosed. 'There's 95 per cent of people walking around with it and they have no idea,' Ms Fairbank said. 'A lot of families that have a history of cancer think it's just a bit of bad luck and there's nothing that can be done about it, but in some cases it isn't bad luck and there are things that can be done. 'If there is such a thing, it can be a good cancer story. There are a lot of things that you can do and it really makes people aware and alert against it. 'People who know about the condition get checked much more regularly, which greatly reduces the overall risk from cancer.' Ms O'Neill said the most important thing is for people to start asking some potentially tough questions. 'There are a lot of factors that go into it, but everyone should be asking questions and looking at their family history,' she said. 'If a lot of people in your family under 50 have or had cancer, head to your GP and ask.' Lynch syndrome not only makes someone more likely to get cancer, but it also means they will likely get the disease earlier in life. In addition to that, Ms O'Neill said she had seen each person in her family get cancer at an early age than their parent or relative of the previous generation. That trend was one of the driving factors in why her and her husband decided against having children of their own. 'There are a lot of factors that went into it - our geneticist actually said it shouldn't stop us from having kids,' she said. 'But, it was a personal decision. I had seen people in my family get cancer at younger and younger ages. 'I was diagnosed at 19. The thought of having a child who would battle with cancer while they were or a teenager or at school was too much.' March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day and Australians are being urged to become aware of their family's cancer history . Lynch syndrome Australia director Eve Raets promoted the day at Rundle Mall in Adelaide over the weekend . March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day, and Mrs O'Neill said the day should be used to make sure people know about the condition.

It's from a few years ago. It shows Bian Liangjing standing proudly in front of a temple gate. \"This is the best one because he looks so handsome,\" she laughs as tears fall on to the album. Bian was on his way back from Singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist's license. His boss decided it was cheaper to fly through Malaysia. He boarded the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year when it disappeared barely an hour into its journey. No trace has ever been found despite an extensive search. But his mother is convinced he's coming back. \"If it is one year, if it is two years or three, I am looking forward to his return. I know he is still alive,\" she says. I first met family members of those who were on the airliner that night as they stood in shock at the arrivals hall of Beijing airport. I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying \"none of those on board survived.\" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. \"I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,\" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience. Families complain of harassment by local communist party officials, several have been detained by Chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media.

Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton: I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off — one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France — especially with the 100 per cent lineout — and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend… if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle — how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running… How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

{"question": "Racing is usually a serious business for the royal family but at Ascot today, Prince Charles was met  a  sight so comical it triggered a fit of giggles. He and Camilla, Duchess of Cambridge, joined onlookers at the Lamb National, in which agile Herdwick sheep hurtle around a specially-built course, leaping over special jumps on a grassy course. The event, which was part of the Prince's Countryside Fund Raceday, clearly tickled Charles who was forced to cover his face as he roared with  laughter at the farm animals' antics. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles catches sight of the sheep hurtling over jumps at the Lamb National in Ascot .

Camilla laughed along with him, clearly enjoying the sight of the  sheep clad in their multi-coloured coats hurtling around the course. And each one had a little  'rider', a cuddly toy dressed a jockey's uniform, holding on to the sheep's reins . The couple were flanked by Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge and Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who looked equally amused by the fluffy runners.

Clutching her headgear with both leather gloved hands, Camilla, who looked elegant in a tweed coat with velvet trim, a silk scarf and knee-high brown suede boots, found her coat whipped open. And as the rain fell, she opened up her clear umbrella as protection against the elements. The couple, who recently returned from a tour of the US, seemed delighted by the rural display and as well as the sheep, the pair marvelled at stalls displaying traditional English wares such as slabs for dry stone walling.

A Californian company says it hopes to offer a $5,000 (£3,400) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue, permanently.

The technique, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, works by using something known as 'scavenger cells' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface. A specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye, before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris . The procedure applies a computer-guided, low-energy laser to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment.

'Under every brown eye is a blue eye,' Dr Gregg Homer, chairman and chief scientific officer at Strōma Medical said.

A Californian company says it will soon be offering a $5,000 (£3,400) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue, permanently . Saj Khan, an ophthalmologist at the London Eye Hospital, told CNN that the procedure could clog up the eye's normal drainage channels. This can in turn cause the pressure inside the eye to go up,' he said. 'If that happens significantly enough, for long enough, it's how patients develop glaucoma,' he said. 'We were concerned about this issue right from the start, so it was the first issue we tested and measured in our initial pre-clinical and clinical studies,' the company wrote on their site. 'Thus far, pigmentary glaucoma has not proved to be a problem in our pre-clinical or clinical studies.' Dr Mark Korolkiewicz, an optometrist and clinical services director at Ultralase, a nationwide laser vision correction specialist, says that there are fundamental differences between the Stroma laser procedure and corrective laser eye surgery. By removing the pigment, light can enter small fibres in the eye. When the light scatters, it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths, which appears blue . The basic rule of thumb is that as soon as you go inside the eye with a laser, you can cause more damage,’ he says. ‘We only use lasers on the cornea, the surface of the eye. This new treatment involves using a laser inside the eye.’ 'Our procedure is limited to the treatment of stromal pigment,' Dr Homer told DailyMail.com.

{"question": "A Penn State professor who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette and ranting about Obama said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience'. Dr Karen Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after a flight from Nicaragua landed at Miami International Airport on Saturday. Halnon said she used the moment to protest 'U.S. military global domination,' claiming the country has 'declared war on Venezuela' and was responsible for giving her hero Hugo Chavez cancer. Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience' when she was filmed smoking and ranting about the US after her plane landed in Miami . The sociology professor also said the US was after Venezuela's water and oil. 'I had to speak out now,' she told Philadelphia Magazine. 'The situation is dire and urgent.' 'Any sacrifice I make for my own self, if it saves lives — there have been far too many lives lost due to U.S. global military domination.' Halnon claims she was 'tortured' by the FBI and TSA after she was arrested in Miami for disorderly conduct. 'I was put in a room with two fans in the ceiling, it was freezing cold for hours and hours and hours,' she said. Halnon alleged she was not allowed to go to the bathroom and had to wet her pants. She said she also defecated on the floor and was forced to pick it up while being 'laughed at'. A number of passengers around Halnon became angered after she lit up on the plane. The professor said the act was a 'symbol'. 'Every revolutionary I know smokes,' she said. 'It was identifying with the revolutionary cause. 'Beyond that, it is a symbol that the United States is a smoking gun.' Halnon also questioned how she got through security with the lighter, which she said was right on top of her book bag. Halnon is seen smoking onboard the flight, in a video uploaded to YouTube and posted on Reddit . When fellow passengers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior, Halnon blamed someone else for smoking and went on a  rant, saying the US had 'declared war on Venezuela' 'The action was necessary,' she said. 'They are going to kill many more people.' During her political rant aboard the flight Halnon, who said she teaches about US imperialism in Latin America, equated the country's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. According to an eyewitness, she also allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. Halnon shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said, laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. But she yelled louder, ranting that Venezuela 'previously owned the oil in Venezuela.' 'My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people would own the oil...not Exon Mobil.' After she was warned again by a flight attendant that she was going to be arrested, Halnon remarked 'I know already.' 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff. A flight attendant, right, warned Halnon that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. Halnon said she knew she was going to be arrested and wanted to speak her piece . It said: 'Penn State Abington is aware of Dr. Karen Halnon’s behavior this past weekend on a flight from Nicaragua and is looking into the matter.' Halnon teaches sociology at the school's Abington campus near Philadelphia, and has the rank of associate professor. According to her faculty page, she is an expert on capitalism, Latin America and 'mad women'. Dr Halnon was award her PhD from Boston College in 1995 with a thesis about treatments for women and hysteria. She has two published books, and more than 25 journal articles to her name. The video of Halnon was captured  by a passenger who then posted the video  to YouTube and Reddit. The redditor, with the user name 'upside down dog', alleged that he was on the same flight as Halnon when he recorded her.

'She only had a single drink on the plane (however, others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers)'.

{"question": "The day before George Osborne delivers his budget to the nation the Lawn Tennis Association came up with its rough equivalent – the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in Great Britain. Chief Executive Michael Downey finally unveiled his vision for the governing body, and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it. Over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing, so that by 2018 around £26 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the United Kingdom. While Andy Murrayis established as one of the world's best players, problems still exist at grass roots level . Other countries will look on enviously at such a huge sum although, given the current rankings of most GB juniors, many may well comfort themselves that their stocks of elite players will be superior for years to come. Downey reaffirmed the LTA's laudable, broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this. However, there was nothing especially original to stir the imagination or make an impact with the wider public, no 'Parks tennis revolution' or some such thing. Anyone wanting to see something more radical to improve the British game would be left disappointed. Not that Downey, the former head of Tennis Canada who was appointed 18months ago, pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long-term plans for the British game. LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game . 'Our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that,' he said at the start. What he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis, like most other ball sports, has with declining participation numbers. They all face a challenge from what he termed 'doorstep' sports, highly convenient and less technically demanding activities such as running, cycling, swimming and going to the gym, which can be done solo and whenever time permits. Despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from Wimbledon profits and that event's ever growing popularity, there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years. The particular problem is among the 16-44 age group with numbers steady above that. Curiously he omitted to mention, until asked, that tennis is now played to a greater or lesser extent in 20,000 schools among 2.6 million children, an impressive figure that would be envied by most other sports. Among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things, there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis. 'I think the old LTA would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools,' he said. The LTA receives millions annually from funds generated by the Wimbledon Championships . There were other sensible ideas. With tennis participation peaking in July, there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year. Clubs, volunteers and coaches will get more support (attempts at this are nothing new). In junior tennis there will, wisely, be more emphasis on team events and there will be a much-needed concentration on creating a less pressured environment at junior tournaments. The emphasis will be on creating inclusive fun and recreational competitions across the board. Downey asserted that he was looking at the 'meat and potatoes' issues, rather than eyecatching initiatives. He also pledged that the LTA would spend money 'like it's your own' (no reference here to his own £434,000 pay package). It is, clearly, expecting too much for any results to be instant, as with the efforts to improve the elite end of tennis. He was unrepentant about cuts to the performance side of the game and funding for lower ranked players, pointing out that the average entry age into the world's top 100 is 21 for men and 20 for women. Murray's victory at SW19 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation . 'If you are 27 years old and still playing Futures I don't think you are going to be a top 50 player. It's a ruthless business,' he said, reiterating the 'no compromise' message he wants to run through the elite end of the sport. While there has to be a degree of patience with his plans, they also illustrated the glacial pace of how things tend to be done at the governing body compared to what would happen in the more dynamic private sector. There are many things that have not even been considered or barely thought about. Andy Murray, for instance, is nearly 28 and there is still no clue as to how to use his profile to spread the game. (Downey presented his ideas to him in Glasgow two weeks ago and was impressed by his interest.). Downey has spoken to Murray after Britain's 3-2 Davis Cup win over USA in Glasgow . TV advertising during the summer is not on the agenda. If there is an embracing of the excellent Tennis For Free charity and its proven methods then it seems limited. The whole key issue of playing surfaces did not raise a flicker, nor did the idea of adopting foreign training base with clay courts and a better climate. No participation targets have been set. The simple idea of trying to rebrand the organisation from its anachronistic 'Lawn Tennis Association' title to something more modern is apparently a non-starter for some reason. What was presented, though, was steady and sensible enough, while not especially imaginative nor wide in scope. Like most budget speeches, the effects of its contents will not be immediately obvious.", "answer": ["LTA have unveiled their long term plan to get more people playing tennis .\nThere will be 50 per cent increase in marketing budget over next four years .\nThere has been five per cent drop in adult participation over last five years .\nChief Michael Downey has spoken to Andy Murray on spreading the game ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Even the world-renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than Arsenal's 'Little Mozart' on his day. Rosicky earned that nickname during his five years with Borussia Dortmund, yet it was in Germany where he was labelled 'wasted talent' and Arsenal gladly signed the maestro in May 2006. 'When he is fit...' seem to be the same, old four words that crop up when Rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet, even at the age of 34, he still knows how to make Arsenal tick. Tomas Rosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' in Germany and he continues to make Arsenal tick at 34 . Olivier Giroud celebrates with Rosicky during their Premier League win against Queens Park Rangers . Rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at Arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic . Pulling on the yellow of Dortmund from 2001, the all-round midfielder's potential was recognised. Remember Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002? Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho, among others, playing in a 'secret tournament' hosted by Eric Cantona. Then, among the world's finest footballers, was a 20-something Rosicky. More than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties, and getting better with age. Take the former Sparta Prague youth's cameo against Everton on March 1, for example. There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0. 'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34? Still producing moments of class like that, he's a brilliant player,' one supporter said in his analysis on ArsenalFanTV afterwards. Rosicky scores against Everton previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining . Rosicky shoots to make it 2-0 to Arsenal against Everton on March 1 and settle their nerves . Rosicky should start against Manchester United but is not guaranteed to do so under Wenger . Rosicky mocked up as his nickname 'Little Mozart' 87 - vs QPR (March 4) 8 - vs Everton (March 1) 9 - vs Monaco (February 25) 14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21) 18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15) That's exactly how it comes – in 'moments'. The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift. The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League. Yet Rosicky – a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way – has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London. The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an Achilles tendon in 2012. It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since. Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates. His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker. There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension. 'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round. Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition. His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second. You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess. Rosicky makes a no-look pass against Brighton which pundit Phil Neville found disrespectful . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it. This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any. Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.", "answer": ["Tomas Rosicky's career has been hampered by injury at times .\nRosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' at Borussia Dortmund .\nThe 34-year-old averages just 19 games per season under Arsene Wenger .\nRosicky starred in Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002 with others such as Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Luis Figo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A British Airways pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the Germanwings disaster in the French Alps last week. Robert Brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer, and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his Boeing 747 in order to 'make a statement'. Now his victim's family say they fear that airlines have not learned from the case and are not making enough effort to assess whether pilots are genuinely fit to fly. Scroll down for video . Parallels: Robert Brown, left, threatened to crash a plane full of passengers just like Andreas Lubitz, right . Victim: Brown killed his estranged wife Joanna, pictured, by repeatedly hitting her with a claw hammer . Brown's case has chilling parallels to that of Andreas Lubitz, who last week flew a plane into the Alps, killing 150 people, after suffering from depression. He had told BA that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife Joanna, and consulted his GP about his illness, but carried on working anyway. In October 2010, Brown argued with his wife while dropping off their two children at her home in Ascot, Berkshire, and hit her 14 times with a claw hammer. He then buried her body in Windsor Great Park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by Joanna's lawyers. 'I thought something needs to be done,' Brown said. 'I thought I want to fly one last time and crash the aircraft. I wanted them to be held accountable. 'I thought if I got to work I could crash an aircraft, or fly to Lagos and crash it there or hang myself in the hotel room. I wanted to make a statement.' Sporty: Brown, a British Airways pilot, is pictured on a long-distance run in BA-branded kit . Warning: Joanna's mother Diana Parkes, right, says airlines should have learned from the case . Instead, he called in sick and another pilot stepped in to fly the BA jumbo jet to Nigeria. Brown was arrested later the same day, and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years. Joanna's mother, Diana Parkes, told the Daily Telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots cannot endanger their passengers. She said: 'Robert Brown's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear, and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from British Airways that lessons can be learnt from that.' The victim's best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton said that there were 'chilling similarities' between Brown's case and that of Lubitz, who were both fitness fanatics. Brown told his BA bosses that he was feeling stressed out, but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly, she said. Plane: Brown had been due to fly a British Airways Boeing 747 similar to this one (file photo) Similarly, Lubitz was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression, but ripped up the doctors' notes he was given excusing him from flying. Mrs Barkworth-Nanton told the Telegraph: 'Neither should have been allowed to fly and put the lives of their passengers at risk. In both cases there were things the airlines should have picked up on. The warning signs were there. 'Robert's terrible crime resulted in him taking the life of Jo, but it could have been much worse, and myself and Jo's family feel that airlines are not learning the lessons of these tragedies.'

{"question": "Eminent psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, known to TV audiences as Dr. Phil, is on his way to Atlanta, Georgia to help the beleaguered boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively. On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, “I’m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].’ In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted ‘You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn’t good enough sorry. ‘ Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, ‘I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.’ Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub . A helping hand: Dr. Phil is concerned about Nick Gordon and his on his way to offer assistance . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother’s death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston’s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina’s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta’s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Nick and Bobbi Kristina in happier times. Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home – a home owned by Houston until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client’s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon – who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ‘sister.’ In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his ‘wife’ refers to her as his ‘fiancée.’ What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ‘hitting each other and swinging’ outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: ‘Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. ‘It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. ‘And Nick like space, that’s where a lot of the tension between them came from.’ He revealed that Gordon was ‘getting a little wild.’ He said: ‘He was getting into car accidents. He’s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He’s got a need for speed. He’s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney’s estate] and crashing them life and right. ‘He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn’t slowing down.’ Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter’s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina’s aunt Marion ‘Pat’ Houston is the executor Whitney’s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read ‘Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,’ were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney’s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon’s ‘sibling’ relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.", "answer": ["On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Nick Gordon's tweets have become increasingly desperate and erratic .\nFriends and family are concerned about Gordon's mental health .\nThey believe Dr. Phil can help Gordon .\nGordon has not been allowed to visit with Bobbi Kristina, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "The embattled former First Lady of Oregon has compared herself to Monica Lewisnky in a Facebook post in which she blasted the media for turning 'public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.' Cylvia Hayes' fiancé John Kitzhaber was forced to resign as governor in February over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm and then cover up the activity. The couple are now facing federal corruption investigations from both the FBI and IRS - though no charges have been levied. Cylvia Hayes' fiancé John Kitzhaber was forced to resign over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm . Hayes compared her own public humiliation with that of Monic Lewinsky, who spoke out about having her life laid bare following revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton . On Tuesday, Hayes posted a link to a TED Talk by Lewinsky called 'The Price of Shame' in which the infamous former White House intern says criticizes the 'rush to judgement' in the media over revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton. 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide,' Lewinsky says. Hayes shared the link with the comment: 'I am so appreciative of her for taking this on. 'This is a powerful statement about how our click-for-cash media business model has turned public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.' It was Hayes' first time speaking out since her fiancé's resignation on on February. She also tweeted out a link to an apology written by a Politico reporter who accused two Secret Service agents of crashing into a barricade while drunk outside the White House. The details of that incident remain unclear. This is the latest example of Hayes and Kitzhaber blaming the media for being forced out of the governor's office. When he resigned Kitzhaber, who has just won a fourth term as governor, blasted the press - saying, 'it is deeply troubling to me to realize that we have come to a place in the history of this great state of ours where a person can be charged, tried, convicted and sentenced by the media with no due process and no independent verification of the allegations involved.'", "answer": ["Cylvia Hayes blasted news media for turning 'public humanization into a commodity and shame into an industry'\nSided with Monica Lewinsky who said she was publicly humiliated for affair with President Bill Clinton .\nHer fiancé John Kitzhaber was forced to resign as governor over claims he helped steer business to her consulting firm and didn't report it .\nHayes and Hitzhaber are facing criminal investigations by the FBI and IRS ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's \"Finding Jesus,\" which airs on Sundays. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page during the latest episode, \"The Gospel of Judas.\" Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Yalanda M. Price: What do scholars know about the man named Judas? What is his story? Mark Goodacre: Judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the New Testament. In fact, the relative lack of information about him in the Gospels has provided the invitation, across the centuries, for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand Jesus over to the authorities. We know very little about his back story from the Gospels. He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. In John's Gospel, he is the disciple who is concerned about Mary wasting money anointing Jesus (John 12.4-6). Soon afterward, he is arranging to hand Jesus over to the authorities. His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died (Acts 1.18-19). Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin . Kristine Spillman Adams: My understanding was always that Judas betrayed Jesus not because he was a villain, but he thought Jesus would start an earthly war when arrested. He was trying to get Jesus to establish a literal, physical kingdom on Earth. Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries of the last week of Jesus' life. What motivated Judas to betray Jesus? John hints that it was financial greed (John 12.6), and Matthew says that he betrayed Jesus for \"thirty pieces of silver\" (Matthew 27.14-15). It is true, though, that many have speculated that Judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter, and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction. With this theory, he was trying to force Jesus' hand. It has sometimes been said that perhaps the word \"Iscariot\" is a corruption of the word \"sicarii,\" which means \"dagger bearer,\" and that would provide some backing to that theory. However, John identifies Judas as \"Son of Simon Iscariot\", which makes the \"sicarii\" theory less likely. In the end, we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about Judas' motivation. Candida Moss answers your questions about John the Baptist . Betsy Wilson-Roark: Are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate? Are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous? Goodacre: That's a good question. Well, we probably have as much of the Gospel of Judas as we will ever have. Several additional fragments of the Codex Tchacos, in which the Gospel of Judas is featured, came to light after Bruce Ferrini, the dealer who owned the codex for some time, went bankrupt. Now, it is estimated that we have something like 90% to 95% of the text. With regards to translation and interpretation, this process will continue for years to come, as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts. I think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job, all the more so as they were working with an incomplete, damaged and very complex Coptic text that had been lost for centuries. But I also greatly admire April DeConick's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the Gospel that this has brought about. I was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the Gospel of Judas dramatized so effectively in \"Finding Jesus.\" Amarylis Didley West: Is there a place that we can find and read the Gospel of Judas? Goodacre: The National Geographic website on the Gospel of Judas does feature the original translation from 2006. As far as I am aware, there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation. Watch the latest episode anytime on CNNgo . NJ Robinson: Good question would be did Jesus know Judas would betray him when/before he chose him? Goodacre: The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus (more accurately \"hand him over\") as soon as they introduce him (e.g. Mark 3.19), but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical Jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction. If you would like to read more about Judas, a good starting point is provided in this article on the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey website.  It is written by \"Finding Jesus\" contributor Bruce Chilton. And if you would like to read more about the Gospel of Judas, \"Finding Jesus\" contributor April DeConick discusses it on Bible Odyssey.

{"question": "Michael Clarke hit a supreme 74 as the departing Australian captain led his country to World Cup glory against New Zealand with a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne on Sunday. A crowd of 93,013 witnessed Australia claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one-sided. New Zealand were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below-par 183 in 45 overs, despite 83 from Grant Elliott – as Mitchell Starc bowled Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch highlights . Australia captain Michael Clarke lifts the World Cup after his country's seven-wicket victory against New Zealand .

Australia's players sprint on to the field after beating rivals New Zealand by seven wickets at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Australia captain Michael Clarke (right) shakes hands with Brendon McCullum after being dismissed for 74 . New Zealand's players look dejected after their disappointing innings cost them the chance of glory in Melbourne . In response, Clarke and Steve Smith shared a 112-run third-wicket partnership as Australia cruised to victory in 34 overs. McCullum called right at the toss and on a sun-bathed Melbourne Cricket Ground the New Zealand captain understandably chose to bat. So often the 33-year-old’s own innings sets the tempo of the Black Caps innings and on Sunday it was no different. Having come out swinging and twice been beaten, McCullum was bowled for a duck by a full, in-swinging Starc delivery that cannoned into off-stump. It sent the MCG crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a World Cup final for the first time ever. Aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen New Zealand boast an average run-rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but Australia’s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one. Clarke’s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive Glenn Maxwell bowled Martin Guptill (15) with just his second ball. And six balls later New Zealand were reduced to 39 for three as Kane Williamson departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive Johnson but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler. It was the perfect start for Australia and Clarke remained on the attack with two new New Zealand batsman at the crease. But Ross Taylor and semi-final hero Elliott steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild, with the latter top-edging Starc for a 72-meter six into the leg side. The pair shared a 111-run fourth-wicket partnership and looked to have brought New Zealand back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse. James Faulkner, who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers, was brought back into the attack and immediately had Taylor caught behind for 40. The 24-year-old Tasmanian deceived the batsman with a slower ball and Brad Haddin took an exceptional low catch, diving to his right, with the ball dying on him. Two balls later the heavy-hitting Corey Anderson was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps. A double-wicket maiden in a World Cup is impressive, a double-wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match-winning moment. Five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi’s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged Starc to Michael Clarke at first slip for a four-ball duck – the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run. Meanwhile, Elliott – fresh from his semi-final match-winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before.

And, whereas Clarke’s one-day international swansong was going to plan Daniel Vettori could only muster nine before a full in-swinging yorker from Johnson hit the 36-year-old’s pad and rattled onto the stumps. New Zealand were crumbling and Elliott having effortlessly moved to 83 became Faulkner’s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by Haddin. When needed most, the Black Caps tail failed to wag and the final wicket run-out perfectly summed up both side’s days up to that point. Boult defended a short Johnson ball to Maxwell at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker’s stumps. Tim Southee’s bat stuck in the ground and he was run-out, as New Zealand stumbled to 183 all out. It was telling that Australia leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line-up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field. Early wickets were going to be vital if New Zealand were going to make their first World Cup final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler, Boult, delivered.

New Zealand's Grant Elliott bats on his way to 83 - the highest score by any player during the Black Caps' innings . Both Australia and New Zealand stand for the national anthems at a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday . Aaron Finch attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads, up into the air and into the waiting Boult’s hands. The Kiwi fans, silent for large parts of the first innings, were now making themselves heard but David Warner soon quieted them once again. Warner found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46-balls before Matt Henry claimed his first wicket of the World Cup having batsman caught at deep square leg, attempting to pull the ball. The loss of the second Australian wicket put McCullum back into an aggressive mindset and Clarke was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30-yard circle. But the right-handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked Southee for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from Henry, having made 74 off 72-balls. And, Smith (56 not out) hit his fifth consecutive half-century as the MCG erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun. It was a disappointing end for New Zealand who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the World Cup. But the day and night belonged to the Australians who once again were crowned as the best one-day team in the world.", "answer": ["New Zealand batted first but set Australia a target of just 184 to win after a disappointing innings .\nBrendon McCullum, Kane Williamson and Martin Guptill were all out early for Mike Hesson's side .\nAaron Finch fell in the second over but Australia regained control through Steve Smith and David Warner .\nCaptain Michael Clarke managed 74 before being bowled by Matt Henry just before the finish .\nSmith scored the decisive runs for Australia as they regained the trophy they last won in 2007 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Arsene Wenger fears Alexis Sanchez is running out of steam and is searching for the right moment to give the £32million Chile striker a well-earned break. Only Per Mertesacker has played more for Arsenal this season than Sanchez, who has played for 3,326 minutes in his debut campaign, scoring 19 goals but only one in his last 11 appearances. 'He's a bit fatigued and in a position where he has scored less,' said boss Wenger. 'He wants to force his game and then is more involved in physical battles.

{"question": "Robert Durst's family is so scared of the suspected-murderer that they have taken out a restraining order against him, even though he is currently behind bars without bail. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000. Prosecutors have charged Durst with capital murder, making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst's (left, in mugshot taken Saturday) family has taken out a restraining order against him, in the wake of his recent arrest on murder charges. Durst's brother Douglas pictured on the right in November 2014. In the state of California, murder convicts can only be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if prosecutors prove that the murder was carried out with a 'special circumstance'. In Durst's case, the alleged special circumstances include killing a witness and lying in wait. Last year, California's death penalty was deemed unconstitutional, but the state will likely appeal the decision. The last time a California death row inmate was executed was in 2006. Durst, 71, was recently the center of HBO documentary The Jinx, and in the final episode which aired Sunday, appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. But Los Angeles Police say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the recording. The latest protective order prohibits Durst from communicating with brother Douglas, his wife Susanne, their children Helena and Alexander, as well as their respective spouses and children. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Durst must stay away from their offices and homes - something he has had difficulty doing in the past. Durst was the recent subject of HBO documentary The Jinx. In the final episode, which aired Sunday, he appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. LAPD say his arrest on Saturday has nothing to do with the show . In April 2013, Durst was arrested for lurking outside of his brother's house. The Jinx follows Durst's long fued with his younger brother Douglas, who father Seymour named head of the multi-billion-dollar family corporation. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Douglas issued a statement on behalf of the family which reads: 'We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.' In addition to the death of Susan Berman, Durst has been linked to the disappearance of his wife Kathleen in 1982, and the homicide of his elderly neighbor Morris Black. Durst was acquitted of Black's murder after claiming he killed and then dismembered the neighbor out of self defense. He is currently being held without bond since he is considered a flight risk. Authorities are currently in the process of extraditing Durst from New Orleans to Los Angeles where the most recent charges were filed.", "answer": ["The restraining order prohibits Durst from contacting brother Douglas, and other members of Douglas' family .\nDurst, 71, was arrested on Saturday on charges of first-degree murder for the execution-style slaying of his friend Susan Berman in 2000 .\nThe former real-estate heir was the focus of recent HBO documentary The Jinx .\nIn the final episode, which aired Sunday, Durst appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks his microphone is turned off .\nLAPD say his Saturday arrest has nothing to do with the documentary ."], "label": "SUM"}

O'Connell has captained Ireland in all but two of the 16 tests since Schmidt took charge but his style of leadership means other players are given their head when it comes to making decisions in the heat of battle.

'It means Jamie (Heaslip) has a definite role. He has some particular things that he leads on, that Johnny Sexton does, that Rob Kearney does, Peter O'Mahony, we have got a number of provincial leaders, Rory Best, who step up and take different roles of leadership.

{"question": "(CNN)Milan has Moxy, while much of Europe is painted Blu. Jaz in the City is playing in Amsterdam come September. EVEN increases the odds of a good night's sleep, while Tune is in harmony with scaled-down budgets. And then there's the vibrant Vib and a new venue, Venu, soon arriving in Dubai. These statements begin to make sense once you realize that they're all the names of modern hotel brands. According to Chekitan S. Dev, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place. But more recently, he says, \"the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic.\" So what's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names, replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages? Look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. Psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded, adventurous individuals in search of new experiences. Hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly. \"Hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way,\" says Matthew Von Ertfelda, Marriott's vice president for insight, strategy and innovation. The explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game. Brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global, online world, say the pros. \"Thanks to social media, millennials are the first global generation,\" says Dr. Donna Quadri-Felitti, academic chair of New York University's School of Professional Studies Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. \"And since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting, hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world.\" For social media purposes, the number of characters in a name counts. Spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity. But another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal. Spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable. \"The odder the name, the less likely someone has already captured it,\" says Cornell professor Dev. \"That's important in terms of intellectual property protection.\" It may explain why Venu and Vib are missing an \"e.\" Venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand, launching its first property in Dubai in 2017. According to parent company Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, it's designed to give travelers \"the freedom to write their own story, their own narrative, to build their own scene.\" Best Western's new hotel entry, called Vib, is pronounced \"vibe.\" \"We tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality, while also connoting a vibrant spirit,\" says Dick Lew, a partner at Houston-based Acumen Design, a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image. Hence Vib, which is derived from \"vibrant.\" Color also plays a big part in hotel branding. \"We incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo, in order to reflect the (Vib) brand's bold personality,\" says Lew. Moxy, the new Marriott partnership with IKEA, is going after \"a sassy, determined, individualistic consumer,\" according to Marriott's Von Ertfelda. The first Moxy opened at Milan's Malpensa Airport in September and more are coming in Europe this year. \"Naming Moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming,\" says Von Ertfelda. \"Once we came up with it, we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot. \"At the same time, though, our lawyers noted the name had to be 'ownable and trademarkable.'\" The change of spelling from moxie to Moxy achieved that. According to Von Ertfelda, senior creative director Maria Rezende-Heiston selected hot pink for the Moxy logo to \"appeal to those who aren't afraid to express themselves\" while using a \"curved font to convey a sense of rhythm, fluidity and independence.\" Color is also key to hotel operator Carlson Rezidor, which is hueing (sic) toward Red and Blu. Blu came about in 2009, after airline SAS withdrew from a partnership with Radisson. After the split, Radisson SAS, a collection of European design hotels, needed a new name. \"We wanted to replace SAS with an equally short name,\" says Rose Anderson, vice president of branding for the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. \"We liked using blue from the old SAS logo, because it brought in the heritage of the former brand. \"At the same time, we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world's favorite color.\" So blue or bleu became Blu, a trademarkable spelling. Carlson Rezidor recently announced a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, \"build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson's brand awareness.\" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there's nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides \"five-star beds at a one-star price.\" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany's Steigenberger Hotel Group's Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be \"hip and happening hotels\" that \"move to the rhythm of today's curious global traveler\" who has a \"desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel.\" You can't explore the hospitality industry's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood. The brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998. \"Starwood was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand,\" says Paul James, global brand leader of W Hotels Worldwide, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. W's target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic. Starwood defined the brand by adding its \"Whatever, Whenever\" tagline to the simple W logo. Cornell's Dev says Starwood further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty, warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material. More than 15 years later, the W Hotel brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide. Journalist Laura Powell started covering the travel industry for CNN in the 1980s.

{"question": "The Prince of Wales and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, ended their second day in the U.S. with a glitzy night out with friends in Washington D.C. The couple, who will celebrate their 10th anniversary next month, put on their best dress for a dinner hosted by Barby Allbritton, the head of the prince's charity in the U.S. and the widow of Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico. The Allbrittons were so close to the British royals that they were two of a few Americans invited to the Royal Wedding between Charles' son Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Charles and Camilla joined Mrs Allbritton, her son Robert - who now runs Politico - and his wife Elena for the black tie charity affair on Wednesday night. The event was so secretive that other guests were only given the address earlier in the day, PageSix reported. Prince Charles and Camila, Duchess of Cornwall, smile outside the a private home on Wednesday where they had dinner.

She is the wife of the late media magnate Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico . The night out came in the middle of the royal couple's four-day trip to the U.S., which is largely being spent in Washington D.C. before a trip to Louisville, Kentucky on Friday. Charles and Camilla still look bright-eyed as they arrived at the party despite a whirlwind day  visiting D.C.'s landmarks and George Washington's plantation before delving into environmental policy. At a meeting of the Global Ocean Commission and the International Sustainability Unit - a charitable group established by the prince to address environmental concerns - Charles spoke about the dangers of accumulating plastic waste in the world's oceans. 'Although the evidence surrounding the links between plastic waste and human health are not yet clear, I would tentatively suggest that they are unlikely to be beneficial,'he said during his 10-minute speech at the Hay Adams hotel. Charles said that he was ‘haunted’ and ‘horrified’ by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations. Passionate: Following a day of sight-seeing on Wednesday, Prince Charles also attended an environmental event at the Hay Adams hotel, where he gave a 10-minute speech on the importance of recycling . Meeting the King: Charles and Camilla arrive at the Martin Luther King Memorial in Washington DC, where they were met by Congresswoman Terri Sewel, left, and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, right . Making friends: The royal couple drew a crowd as they arrived at the Memorial on Tuesday . Fans: Members of the public, including a middle school history class, snap photos of the royal couple . ‘Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month’s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp that solution,’ he said. His impassioned speech came after he and his wife took time out to play tourists. On Wednesday morning, the couple wrapped up against the brisk temperatures for their 20-minute tour of the Martin Luther King memorial and paused to read his quotations engraved in the stone. 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that,' read one quotation where the royal couple paused to see King's words from 1963. Harry Johnson, the president of the foundation that built the King memorial, said he gave the royal couple a stone from the memorial's granite as a gift. The couple then visited the Lincoln Memorial, where they were greeted by historians. Towering: The royals posed in front of the memorials with members of congress and civil rights leaders . Paying their respects: Charles and Camilla speak with Ed Jackson during their tour of the memorial . Taking the tour: Camilla, who was chic in a grey coat, was shown around by Congresswoman Terri Sewel . During the visit, they were happy to chat with students on field trips. Joan Darby, who brought her U.S. history class from Stafford, Virginia, to the King memorial said they were thrilled to meet Charles and Camilla, along with civil rights leaders Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis. 'To come here and have such a joyful event was just really incredible luck on our part,' she said. Camilla, who was showing off a chic new hairstyle, obligingly stopped for a selfie before continuing on with U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell by her side. Charles and Camilla were then whisked off to Mount Vernon, where they were met by the Governor and First Lady of Virginia, Terry and Dorothy McAuliffe. One of the most historic spots in the US, parts of the estate have been in the Washington family since the mid-17th century and it was at Mount Vernon that George Washington, the first president of the United States, lived. Spectacular: The white marble monument is arguably the most famous in Washington D.C . Spotted: The royal couple were spotted by a party of American schoolchildren and swiftly surrounded .

Prince Charles, who arrived in the U.S. yesterday evening with his wife, also visited the National Archives today  to view the 1297 Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence. The document, a successor to the original 1209 charter, was reissued by Edward I as a quid pro quo for extra funds with which to wage war on Scotland. It was also on a tour of the National Archives that Charles learned his uncle once developed a new polo stick.  National Archivist David Ferriero presented the prince with a patent application submitted in 1931 by his uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, for a new kind of polo stick. Charles, himself a polo player, laughed and said he had no idea that his uncle had designed a polo stick. He also laughed when shown a telegram from the U.S. embassy in London to the Secretary of State, sent in 1957 seeking instructions to ensure that a toy car that had been given to Charles, then 8 years old, would be working properly when he returned home to play with it. Camilla, meanwhile, visited the Shakespeare Theatre Company. During an afternoon visit to the National Archives, Prince Charles laughs as he's shown a telegram from the American Embassy in London to the U.S. Secretary of State in 1957, asking for instructions on how to operate a toy car that was to be gifted to the then 8-year-old prince .

'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said. 'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.'

{"question": "A 66-year-old man told his wife that he feared hospital staff were 'trying to kill him' a day before they put him on a 'do not resuscitate' notice without the consent of his family, an inquest has heard. Michael Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died at James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,  after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow said. The great-grandfather, who died in October 2013, had been ill for several years with a lung condition which caused his breathing to stop but had been given more than a year to live. Heartbroken: Michael Richardson died at James Paget University Hospital after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow, Janet (pictured with her late husband) said told an inquest today. Right, Mr Richardson . Giving evidence at an inquest, his widow, Janet, said her husband had tried to discharge himself the day before his death after becoming concerned about the levels of oxygen he was being given. Speaking at the inquest in Norfolk, she said: 'He said, \"I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me\". 'I said, \"I love you\", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive. 'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.' The 66-year-old accused medics of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family. The inquest heard the family, who had recently moved to Norfolk from Deal, Kent, only learned of the notice when they picked up Mr Richardson's death certificate from the hospital four days after he died. Janet Richardson (centre, with a photo of Mr Richardson) with daughters Jocelin Taylor (left) and Antonia Richardson (right). The widow claimed she only learned of the DNR order four days after her husband's death . Asked by assistant coroner David Osborne if she had given consent for this, Mrs Richardson said: 'No, nothing at all.' She added: 'I visited the hospital twice a day.  There would have been loads of opportunities for staff to talk to me. If he had been asked about the DNR notice, he would have said no, I know that. 'He used to say, \"some life is better than no life, you're a long time dead\". He was well aware he would die at some point, just not that quickly.' Mr Richardson, who was born in Islington, London, was diagnosed with the lung-scarring condition pulmonary fibrosis  in 2008 and received oxygen therapy at home. On October 24 2013, his condition deteriorated and his family called an ambulance which took him to the hospital. Mrs Richardson said he had been moved between various wards and when she visited him he 'seemed worse than when he went in'. Although his medical notes correctly identified pulmonary fibrosis as his main condition, he was initially treated for emphysema, Mrs Richardson said. When she pointed this out, doctors increased his oxygen levels. She also described how her husband had been left to lie on soiled sheets and was not being regularly washed. Care: Mrs Richardson accused medics at James Paget University Hospital of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family . Nurse Louise Curtis described how staff had initially rushed to resuscitate Mr Richardson after an emergency alarm was activated. But as they tried to save his life, a colleague checked his notes and pointed out the DNR notice so they stopped these efforts.

{"question": "Those who would love to see the lesser spotted Laura Robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation. Having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week’s Miami Open, she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month’s WTA Tour event in Bogota, and the new target for her return appears to be the French Open in May. That suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again, having not played since the Australian Open in January last year. Former British No 1 Laura Robson protects her wrist while out in London . Nobody is more frustrated about this than Robson herself, now 21 and without a world ranking. She would dearly love to be in Miami now, but instead is back practising over in Bradenton near Tampa at the IMG Academy. Perhaps encouragingly, she posted a picture of herself on Twitter doing a full, tendon-testing handstand. Robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career, which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in Melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery. Here this week her manager, Max Eisenbud, issued a positive-sounding update while preaching patience: “I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,” he said. “ It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.” Among Eisenbud’s other clients include Maria Sharapova, whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach. “I learned a lot from the whole experience with Maria, and that’s why I feel strongly about not rushing it. Laura is still young with a lot of time ahead.” Sharapova seems to have won her battle, but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for Robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident. When she finally decided to go for surgery last April to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who has had operations on both wrists. She used the same specialist at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota. Ironically this has turned out to be the Argentine’s own comeback event and on Thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to Vasek Pospisil. The fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an abortive return in January shows just how infernally complex wrist injuries are for tennis players. He was just delighted to be back on court: “It's not 100% free, but I felt even better than Sydney tournament in January,” he said. “ It's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist. I feel better week by week, but it's still very early to feel 100%. “Mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm, looking forward for the future. I'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon. I want to play tennis. It doesn't matter how long it's take me to be in the top again.” Being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves. An example of this is 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva, who was out for 17 months following the 2012 Olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery. Robson has sought the advice of 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro . Del Potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the Miami Open . Since returning at the start of last year the talented Russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153. She lost another first round here this week. So it could be hard for Robson whenever she returns, although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker. That much was clear when, enjoying a rare spell free from injury, she became the first British player since Jo Durie to reach the world’s top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19. It might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return. When she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in Nike after being dropped by adidas, and will be coached by Colombian Mauricio Hadad, a former guide of Heather Watson.

It was really refreshing.' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date in Bridlington the following August.

{"question": "(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. \"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\" Riley said. \"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\" she said. \"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \"We're still working with them to get good data,\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\" she said.", "answer": ["FDA official says Olympus never got permission to sell its endoscope .\nMedical device is connected to CRE outbreak in California that's left two people dead ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Hidden in a vault in Marrakesh, it has been one of the most highly-anticipated albums in music history. And tonight, after six years, the Wu-Tang Clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - before sealing it away once more. In an attempt to break free from the Spotify and YouTube era of freely-shared music, rap's most influential collective is selling the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. After a private online-only sale this month through art dealers Paddle8 - which employs Britain's Princess Eugenie - the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with the group's de facto leader RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103. Scroll down for video . Unprecendented: This is the Wu-Tang Clan's record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin that was played on Monday night to a small group before it is sold and kept secret until the year 2103. It has been six years in the making . The record comes in a silver, jeweled box with a specially-designed wax seal and a leather-bound book . The box: It was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation . The Staten Island-born group revived the East Coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s . Confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance, Cher's voice bellowed out during the 13-minute extract. And though it wasn't played, DailyMail.com understands it to be true that Barcelona FC players also make a cameo appearance. Typical of the group's first record 36 Chambers, it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples, clips of dialogue from movies, and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder. Reiterating its own grandeur, there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say, 'this has never been done before.' All of the Staten Island clan's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts. The record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in Morocco, with a seal designed and printed by wax-smiths in Serbia. 'This has never been done before,' RZA told DailyMail.com after playing the record. 'Music is just handed out now, the industry is in crisis. People feel like they deserve to have it for free. This is art. You can take a picture of the Mona Lisa but that's not art. 'The same with this: you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing.' The pre-sale event played up to the idea. Those invited were subjected to airport-style security checks, and electronic devices were confiscated. In a dark room, buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played. The nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight, with two bodyguards standing either side. While some  were fans, others were advisers who hailed from as far as Asia to inspect the 'artwork'. One adviser for a Chinese collector, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like Wu-Tang or not. The box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining. Inside, is a cinematic-style record, plus a leather-bound 174-page manuscript printed on gilded Fedrigoni Marina parchment with lyrics, credits, tales about the recording. The adviser said: 'Someone said it would be worth $1 million. That's nothing. This is something completely different; completely new. I don't think I could put a price on it. 'The concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history... It is huge.' The Wu-Tang Clan formed in the early 1990s, reviving the East Coast's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop. RZA - pronounced 'rizza' - drew together nine MCs, including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms Ol' Dirty Bastard and GZA. The remaining slots were filled by Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck. Ambition: RZA, né Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, wants the long-awaited album to be treated like a work of art . Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA (pictured) but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougar . The new album pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry . With industry domination in their sights, RZA saw that each member of the Clan was signed with different production companies, while maintaining their loyalty as a group. Their first album, 36 Chambers, was hailed as unprecedented, with samples from soul music and kung fu movies. Spanning 128 minutes, the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in Staten Island, New York, and hark back to their original mid-90s lyrics about the Shaolin. It features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers. And as for Cher's cameo appearance, RZA said: 'Did nobody ever have a crush on Cher? She's the ultimate. Ain't nobody like Cher.' Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougarh - a Wu-Tang fan who visited the group's New York office five times until they took him on. Cilvaringz explains he and RZA were already developing the concept of a record charting the Wu's history when the music industry changed completely. Once Upon A Time In Shaolin has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the Wu's Shaolin symbol and a decorative design by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist . Collectively, the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other . Within five years singles plummeted to the price of $0.99, and artists were streaming their work for free. Simultaneously, Cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in Morocco, where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars. 'That [was] the first time I asked myself: \"Why and how are these artists valued at such a price?\" People like Dre or Kanye or RZA are geniuses in what they do, and their music is valued at 99 cents. 'No disrespect to Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Damien Hirst, or any other artists, but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly, \"Do you know Damien Hirst? Do you know Basquiat?\" they'll say \"Who?\" If you say, \"Do you know Dr. Dre? Do you know Kanye?,\" they'll say \"Yeah.\"' The album, he says, pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry. The group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts, thereby dominating the recording industry . 36 Chambers: This was the collective's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene . And despite years of disputes erupting between the clan's members, RZA insists that there was 'no tension' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album, adding 'the eight members, excluding myself, are the most talented MCs I have ever encountered. They are true artists because they aren't taught. You can't teach art.' Speaking later with Genius executive editor Sasha Frere-Jones, RZA described his ambitions: 'Maybe Richard Branson will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet. That'd be dope!' However, Cilvaringz conceded, the fact that the buyer cannot commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free. 'I hope they don't,' RZA said. 'This is unique and something only has value if it is rare.'", "answer": ["Wu-Tang Clan is selling new album for millions of dollars via Paddle8 .\nSole buyer cannot share much-anticipated double LP for at least 88 years .\nOn Monday night, group played the album to a few in Queens, New York .\nDailyMail.com among those to hear it for first - and last time before 2103 .\nRZA described the music as 'exclusive' and 'piece of contemporary art'\nCher  appears on the record because 'who didn't have a crush on Cher?'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It has been a multi-million pound rescue mission lasting 12 years, but 900-year-old Cardigan Castle, in Wales, is set open its doors to visitors once more in April. Tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to the historic castle, to see the results of the Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust project. It is set to be a lavish affair, with 3,000 daffodils and 1,700 rolls of turf planted in celebration of the occasion. Cardigan Castle is set to open in April, after an £12m renovation. It is hoped that the Castle will become one of west Wales’ top tourist destinations, attracting at least 33,000 visitors in the first year . The castle, which has been unoccupied since 1996, will open its doors to visitors in April, following an extensive £12m restoration project which began in 2011 . The new lease of life for the castle includes the recreation of the paths and lawns of the regency gardens, a  glass restaurant with panoramic views over the River Teifi, and the restoration of the whalebone arch – a popular feature for early 19th Century gardens. The impressive landmark has a fascinating history, from being build as a wooden Iron Age settlement by Gilbert de Clare in 1100, to enduring medieval battles between Normans and Welsh rebels, and hosting Wales' first Eisteddfod in 1176. The last inhabitant was Barbara Wood, who sold the castle in 2001 after residing there for almost 60 years. The redevelopment of the site has included the recreation of the paths and lawns of the Regency gardens and the fitting of a floor-to-ceiling glass restaurant . In 1165, The Lord Rhys and his Welsh army captured the castle and Cardigan became the first town in the country to be occupied by the Welsh . The design of some elements of the stone castle were inspired by the crusades and are the earliest examples of this work in the UK . The summer will feature events including an open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the castle, the people who lived there, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod . The castle was purchased by the council in 2003 and began being repaired as part of the regeneration of Cardigan by the CBPT charity. Jann Tucker, chair of CBPT, who was recently awarded an MBE for her efforts in preserving Welsh heritage, said: 'It's been a long time coming but the finishing post is nearly in sight. We have worked so long and so hard for this. 'The Castle will really put Cardigan on the map.' Through extensive refurbishment, and many hours work from numerous volunteers, the derelict site has been transformed into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue. The renovation has transformed the house, previously inhabited by Barbara Wood, and restored the building for guests. Barbara was the last person to live in the castle and moved to the site as a young girl in July 1940 . Situated on raised ground overlooking the River Teifi, the site of Cardigan Castle has been an ideal location for thousands of years. This was confirmed by archaeologists in 2012 when Neolithic flint scrapers were unearthed in the castle’s grounds . Cardigan Castle has seen many battles over the years. A lesser known siege took place in 1138 when the Welsh attacked the Norman base with the help of Viking mercenaries . Cris Tomos, Castle Director, said: 'We're busy putting the finishing touches in place and are looking forward to opening ahead of the May bank holidays and summer school break. 'And there's plenty to attract visitors to the Castle over the summer months, with an exciting programme of events, from open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the Castle, the people who lived here, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod.' Funding for the grand project came from the Heritage Lottery Fund (£6m) and European Regional Development Fund (£4.3m), with the rest provided by other council and heritage trust funds. The grand opening will be Wednesday 15 April 2015. The project has seen the site transformed from a derelict building into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue .", "answer": ["Cardigan Castle is  to open after 12 years of renovation on April 15, 2015 .\nThe 900-year-old historic site is set to be the top west Wales attraction .\n9,500 archaeological artifacts have been discovered at the castle ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see. \"She was barely conscious. It was very hard to keep her attention at the moment,\" Sawyer told CNN's Erin Burnett. \" And she was covered in blood. It was one of the most horrific crime scenes I have seen.\" The officer grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to find where she was injured. Michelle Wilkins was weak and in shock when police arrived. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. \"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,\" Sawyer said. \"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now.\" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. \"When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it.\" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. \"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,\" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, \"She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.\" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who \"saved her own life.\" The fetus died, but the mother survived and \"is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,\" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, \"We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.\" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.", "answer": ["Officers responding to 911 call found Michelle Wilkins covered in blood .\nWilkins was stabbed and had fetus torn out after she answered a Craigslist ad ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "(CNN)An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed Al-Jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow. Al-Jumaili's wife was with them taking photos. Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and \"just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.\" There is \"extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,\" said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of \"a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.\" Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether  Al-Jumaili was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out, Al-Jumaili cried \"I'm hit!\" according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim's relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where Al-Jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot. Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and Al-Jumaili and his family. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males. Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon. Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. \"We can't solve this crime alone,\" he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said. Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it. She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family's expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward.

{"question": "Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work in a few seconds of mindless vandalism . This is the shocking moment a gang of bullies set fire to a schoolgirl's GCSE coursework - before sending her a video of the cruel prank. Rhiannon Blair was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work. The 15-year-old had not realised the work was missing until she was sent the video by her tormentors - who were suspended for just three days after the act of mindless vandalism. The footage shows the teenage bullies laughing and joking as they poured lighter fluid over the pile of papers on a picnic bench and set it alight. One boy even attempted to fan the flames by spraying it with a deodorant can while another threw in a lighter which eventually caused the notes to explode. A pupil then climbed onto the bench to trample over the cindered books. Police yesterday were investigating after the footage was posted online, but confirmed there had been no arrests so far. Rhiannon said she has been the victim of a campaign of bullying at Easthampstead Park Community School in Bracknell, Berkshire, since last September and suffered from anxiety and depression as a result. She now fears the stunt may put her entry to college in jeopardy. She said: 'I was shocked and disgusted when I was sent the video by one of the pupils involved. None of them seems to be sorry for what they have done or show any regret. I am just very upset and tearful that all my hard work has gone to waste. 'I have always wanted to work with children and it is what I had set my heart on doing for the rest of my life. I am not even sure if I can get a place on my course at the college anymore. I can't understand why anyone would do this.' The  teenager, who dreams of a career as a nursery nurse, was just two weeks away from submitting the coursework when the bullies destroyed her work. One of the bullies shouts 'put a lighter on it' as another prepares to set fire to Rhiannon's coursework . Two boys reel away as the flaming pile of notes explodes thanks to a lighter that had been thrown on them . Her mother, Debbie Groom, said: 'I am so angry. These pupils have ruined my daughter's life. I would be mortified if that was my child carrying out that sort of behaviour. 'This incident is going to scar Rhiannon for life. She has been very stressed and upset but the reaction to the video being posted online has been amazing - it just shows that people do not like bullies.' Another pupil, 15-year-old Kayleigh Holloway from Hanworth, also had her child development coursework destroyed in the pile. Her uncle Neil Holloway said: 'I am disgusted by what has happened. I don't think the three days suspension given to the children involved was not enough punishment. 'They have all probably seen it as a nice holiday. Even though the school has said her grades won't be affected that is not the answer or what we want to hear. 'Kayleigh was very upset when she found out - she has got enough going on in her life without all of this.' Rihannon's mother Debbie Groom (pictured with Rhiannon's family, L-R:  aunt Anne Yates, mother Debbie Groom, Rhiannon Blair and her sister Katie Blair) said the incident had scarred her daughter for life . Headteacher Liz Cook said letters had been sent out to everybody involved in the incident and assured the victims that their grades would not be affected. She said: 'The school has investigated the incident at length and its origins were a falling out between girls, property was taken as a spiteful act designed to disrupt the victim's lesson the following day. 'On reflection students have realised this act was a huge error of judgement on their part and have been shocked that their act has attracted a social media storm. 'This has been a steep learning curve for them all. The victims of the theft are also being supported as we make every effort to make sure their hard work and studies are not compromised.

{"question": "A CEO who reportedly died of a heart attack in Venezuela two years ago has been arrested on fraud charges after being captured by the FBI at his remote North Carolina hideout. Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested on Saturday wearing a brown toupee and a dyed beard. Each count carries a possible 30-year sentence. Just a few years ago, Lantigua's family appeared to be living the American Dream. The Cuban immigrant claimed he had a heroic military career and earned numerous degrees before running a successful furniture business. He owned a Florida beachfront condo and a new home atop a verdant North Carolina mountain. But in 2012, as his Circle K Furniture company slid deeper into debt, those who knew Lantigua said he'd made some odd decisions: he ordered tons of new furniture on the company dime for his family's many homes. Scroll down for video . Jose Lantigua and wife Daphne Wilson celebrating New Year's Eve 2013. Three months later, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela, his body cremated there instead of returned home. He was arrested this weekend on fraud charges in North Carolina . Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . FBI agents execute a search warrant at the Sapphire, North Carolina, home of Jose Lantigua on Monday. Lantigua, a Jacksonville businessman reported dead two years ago in Venezuela, was arrested in North Carolina on Saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they shouldn't be making payments . He replaced the bookkeeper he'd used for years with a relative. He built a panic room with steel doors inside his North Carolina hideaway. And, prosecutors say, he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $8 million from insurance companies. No matter how the criminal case turns out, his arrest gives a resolute end to a long-running court battle between Lantigua's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because, for many reasons proven right, they didn't think he was dead. 'I've never seen anything quite like (this case),' said Joe Licandro, a Jacksonville prosecutor working the case. 'There was always a suspicion, but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did, and she didn't have any missteps either - until recently.' Lantigua, who had emigrated to the U.S. as a youth, purchased Circle K Furniture in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the U.S. Army, where he claimed to have earned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest military honor for bravery. Jose Antigua with his heavily-pregnant daughter Christina on New Year's Eve 2013 before he allegedly faked his own death. Friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father's reported passing in 2013 . Months after her father's alleged passing, Christina Lantigua posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below. Neither the businessman's daughter or son, Joseph, have been charged with a crime . The Army has not responded to requests for confirmation. He also graduated from Florida International University in 1989 with a degree in computer science, the school said, and claimed degrees in management, mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from Pepperdine University, Northwestern University and the University of Florida, respectively. UF said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and Northwestern had no record of him. Pepperdine did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. By the time Lantigua bought Circle K Furniture, it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large Jacksonville showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country-style pieces made from logs. Problems surfaced in 2012, when Lantigua told friends and colleagues he'd fallen ill and needed to go to Venezuela to get an experimental treatment not available in the United States. Simpson stood by his side with an expression of worry, people who know the couple said. Records showed they sold their Jacksonville-area condo for $600,000. About this time, Circle K was also developing financial problems. No one suspected anything suspicious at first, said Kathleen Leis, who was Circle K's bookkeeper. But as the company's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said Lantigua kept buying furniture for his family with company funds. Still, she trusted the man, whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems. Then Lantigua replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister-in-law. 'I wasn't given a reason except I was needed more on the floor and his sister-in-law couldn't sell furniture,' she said. Before long, Lantigua headed to Venezuela to deal with his alleged illness. Lantigua ran the once successful Circle K furniture company (pictured) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 . Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, are jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home. Circle K's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy. Lantigua's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $8 million in policies he'd obtained. At his June 2013 memorial service at High Point Community Church in suburban Jacksonville, Lantigua's daughter, Christina, sang 'Amazing Grace' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on. Meanwhile, American General Life Companies had suspicions about the $2 million claim Lantigua's son, Joseph, had filed, particularly the Venezuelan death and cremation certificates accompanying it. First, the physician who signed Lantigua's death certificate never received or examined the body. The investigators also said there had been no autopsy. Finally, the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where Lantigua supposedly died. Investigators found that suspicious. 'The insured's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures,' American General said in court documents. The crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents, the company said. Last November, American General denied the claim and lawsuits were filed. Joseph Lantigua has not responded to several phone messages  seeking comment. No contact information for Christina Lantigua could be found. Neither has been charged with a crime. American General's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors, who opened an investigation that included surveillance. At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville. 'It's possible that he's been hiding out there these past couple of years,' said Licandro, the Jacksonville prosecutor. Residents of the nearby village of Sapphire said the area is perfect for hiding out: only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves. But Lantigua apparently thought trouble was coming. He built a bunker in his basement complete with 20-inch thick steel doors, said a contractor who worked on the house. 'It made me wonder why would you need a panic (room) here? There's not that many people around here you got to worry about,' said Forrest Boutte, 28. Boutte said Lantigua was a nice, straightforward man. On Saturday, U.S. State Department security agents arrested Lantigua near the Hogback Mountain home. The passport he had used to get back into the U.S. had proved his downfall. The man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black — the photo Lantigua submitted showed he is white. The Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917. Suspicious, State Department agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity. Finding him wasn't hard — while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged, he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct North Carolina address. For those who knew him, the news that he was still alive was startling. 'I'm just shocked. He didn't seem that type at all. He seemed to me an upstanding, Christian family man. He was nice to everybody and wanted help people,' Leis said. It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home (pictured) At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville .", "answer": ["Jose Lantigua, 62, and wife, Daphne Simpson, 57, jailed on insurance fraud charges after he was arrested by FBI on Saturday in North Carolina .\nIn April 2013, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela and his body cremated there instead of returned home .\nThe passport Lantigua used was his downfall - the man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black .\nThe Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Jonny Evans' actions in spitting at Papiss Cisse were 'simply disgusting', a Football Association regulatory commission ruled. The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre?

'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.'

{"question": "(CNN)As more details about the infamous ISIS executioner \"Jihadi John\" become known, certain basic questions continue to be raised. Is Islam as a faith to be blamed for Mohammed Emwazi's voyage to ISIS, otherwise known as the Islamic State? Or is the \"War On Terror\" responsible, and is this merely \"chickens coming home to roost?\" The temptation is to come to simplistic answers. Confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in ISIS propaganda videos, many take what their propagandists say very seriously: That they are, indeed, doing what their faith tells them to do. On the other hand, few believed ISIS when it was claimed they would negotiate with the Japanese authorities to release one of their citizens captured in Syria, who was later killed. Taking ISIS at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things. There have been other neo-religious movements in both Muslim and Christian history. The \"Assassins,\" for example, which began in the 11th century, was a radical, heterodox movement of Muslims, which eventually died out -- in its own time, similar to ISIS today, it was decried and depicted as deviant by Muslim religious authorities as well as most Muslims. Among Christendom, many of the Nazi leadership in the 20th century espoused an ideology called \"Positive Christianity.\" It obviously never attracted much of a following, and historians claim, \"Only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal Protestantism would recognize such a mish-mash as true Christianity.\" Why, then, are we not prepared to expunge Islam from the mix when interrogating ISIS ideology? While most churches, Protestant and Catholic, rejected the \"Positive Christianity\" of Nazi Germany, there is no corresponding action from the world of Islam. The problem is, that's not entirely possible. Unlike Christendom, Islam does not admit a hierarchical, ecclesiastical authority -- so, no \"Muslim Church\" or \"Islamic Pope\" exists. Having said that, nevertheless, there are systems of religious authority in Islam. They are more akin to academic peer review structures -- indeed, the concept of the modern university comes from the medieval Muslim seminary. Since the dawn of ISIS, numerous Muslim religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by ISIS, on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves. That is, except for ISIS itself, and for some odd reason, some in the West who insist on taking ISIS at its word. Religious authorities at large, and Muslims in general, may recognize ISIS members as Muslims, albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals. Just as Europeans en masse rejected the claims of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass killer, who claimed \"Christianity\" as a motivator, without denying he considered himself to be a Christian. In both cases, it is important to understand how this ideology is internally justified, and on what basis, particularly in terms of establishing methods for immunizing vulnerable people from possible recruitment strategies. That doesn't, nevertheless, entail recognizing their claims as accurate -- only that they take them seriously, and others may too. That question of \"vulnerability\" has also been brought up a great deal in the last couple of weeks. There were some in the UK who argued that Jihadi John was subjected to a type of harassment by the British security services that proved to be a causal factor in his radicalization process. In one interview, the lobby group, Cage Prisoners, insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in Syria: \"The man who cut off their heads, and if you take that back a step, the people who potentially helped in his radicalization; in this case, the security services.\" Specialists in the field of radicalization took great exception to the implication, with experts from the likes of Exeter University and Kings College London describing it as \"absurd,\" and \"bizarre.\" Certainly, there are questions to be raised with regards to the British security services -- including how Jihadi John, who was known to them, was allowed to leave the country, as well as how suspects are interrogated and questioned. There shouldn't be any sensitivity about this -- the British security services do the job that they do precisely so Britons live in a society open enough to be able to ask these questions without fear or reprisal. Nevertheless, the suggestion that the British security services somehow radicalized Jihadi John is peculiar. There are many high-profile members of ISIS in Syria and Iraq who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example, Lotfi Arrifin, a youth leader in a Malaysian political party. There are also many who have undergone far more invasive encounters with other security establishments worldwide, at the hands of authoritarian governments in the Arab world and elsewhere -- they did not suddenly register for service in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. Does it make them more vulnerable to possible recruitment? It very well could -- but that's not a foregone conclusion. Otherwise, given the scale of autocratic oppression in recent history, we should have seen far more members of ISIS. There will be those who contend radical Islamist theology is all we need to look at in understanding radicalization -- there will be others who will place all attention on domestic issues such as the security services, or foreign policy. The reality is, however, there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of ISIS or any other radical Islamist group. For different individuals, different factors make them vulnerable to recruitment. More often than not, a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of \"meaning\" in this world -- and repugnant though ISIS ideology may be, it does provide a sense of certainty. What makes recruits more attuned to that kind of absolutism as opposed to going down other paths? It may be many things that condition them before they accept radical Islamism as their \"savior.\" In all cases, nevertheless, there are two things we ought to keep foremost in mind. We must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through, to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context, only one person has responsibility for their actions. Each one of them, themselves.", "answer": ["H.A. Hellyer: There is no template for explaining an individual's journey to a group like ISIS .\nOften a recruit will find themselves looking for \"meaning\" and ISIS provides certainty, says Hellyer .\nHe adds: Regardless of context, each individual must take responsibility for their own actions ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Relentless Robbie Neilson  celebrated Hearts clinching the Championship title in March — then ordered his team to smash Hibs’ second-tier record points total. An unexpected 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road yesterday left the Tynecastle side — who had beaten Falkirk 3-0 at Westfield 24 hours earlier — an unassailable 23 points clear of Hibs with 21 points left on the board. Neilson learned his team had secured a return to the Premiership without kicking a ball while he was studying for his pro licence at Stirling University yesterday afternoon. Robbie Neilson wants his Hearts team to surpass Hibernian's second-tier points total . Hearts ended up securing their title a day after a 3-0 win against Falkirk . Rangers beat Hibernian to give Hearts an unassailable advantage at the top of the league . But, despite the league being finally in the bag, the 34-year-old vowed there will be no let-up as Hearts hope to usurp Hibs’ record tally of 89 points, set under Alex McLeish in 1999. Should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches, the rampant Gorgie outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points. ‘It’s a fantastic achievement to win the league. It’s a great day for the club,’ said Neilson. ‘The objective for the season was to get promoted. We’ve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season — but we need to keep winning games. ‘We’ve got seven games left and we want maximum points. We won’t be losing focus. If we could set a new record for points for the division, then that would be fantastic. ‘When you play for a club with the stature of Hearts, you have to keep winning games — and that’s what we need to do. ‘I will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games. We can’t be turning up at venues and losing games. We want to win, starting with three more points against Queen of the South at Tynecastle next weekend.’ Neilson believes his side’s 2-1 stoppage-time win at Ibrox against Rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign. But it wasn’t until a battling 2-1 victory at Queen of the South on February 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away. ‘I don’t think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line,’ he said. ‘But I think that Queen of the South game was a big one for us away from home. We went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points. We eventually got there and, from then on, I thought we had a real chance of taking the league. ‘But that win against Rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans. A lot of times you can go to Ibrox, go ahead and then Rangers draw level and you’re then hoping to hang on for a draw. Hearts' Genero Zeefuik celebrates after giving his side two-goal lead against Falkirk . The Hearts players celebrate as they beat Falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win . ‘But we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season. It gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we’ve done it. ‘To finally get over the line is magnificent. The players have worked so hard and I couldn’t have asked for more. ‘We can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate. We’ve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them. ‘It’s just a great day and it’s testament to the support we’ve had all season from the fans, the hard work of (owner) Ann Budge and (director of football) Craig Levein and all the players. ‘The fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks.’ Meanwhile, Hearts captain Danny Wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions-in-waiting. Hearts captain Danny Wilson revealed his joy after his side became Scottish Championship winners . ‘It has been difficult, you know,’ he said. ‘Since maybe late December and early January people have had us installed as champions. So it’s been tough, not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side. But we’ve done that. ‘The way the season has panned out, we’ve been going about our business in the right fashion.

The one-bedroom flat in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, valued at £20,000, is coming up for auction at the end of the month, making it almost certainly the cheapest flat in Britain.

Location, location, location: This one-bed flat on the holiday island of Bute, Scotland, is coming up for auction for just £1, despite being valued at around £20,000 . Seller Catherine Scott, 58, said the flat belonged to her late husband and the family chose the low asking price because they are looking for 'a quick sale' ‘It has been in his family for a long time, but it is a lovely flat and would make someone a very nice little holiday home.’ The sandstone property is in Rothesay town centre, close to the 13th century castle and a five-minute walk from the harbour – although it does not offer sea views. Auction House Scotland will put the property under the hammer in Glasgow at 2pm on March 26. The company’s website describes the auction sale as ‘an excellent opportunity to purchase a Scottish holiday home or a buy-to-let investment for only £1’.

Auctioneers say the guide price of just £1 has attracted a lot of interest so far, and they are expecting the property to be snapped up quickly on March 26 . ‘When the hammer falls, it’s a done deal. Whereas if you are buying from an estate agent, it can drag on – about 30 per cent of estate agent deals fall through . ‘The flat can be a place you can go to for a short break, or you can rent it out.’ Market experts said the flat could be rented out at £364 per month.", "answer": ["One-bed flat in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, has been valued at around £20,000 .\nBut seller Catherine Scott, 58, is offering it for £1 in order to get 'quick sale'\nProperty is close to 13th century castle and a short walk from harbour ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Paddy McNair admits he will fulfil his boyhood dream if he earns his first Northern Ireland cap against Scotland on Wednesday night. The Manchester United defender has been given his first taste of top-team action at Old Trafford by new boss Louis van Gaal this season. Now he is set to follow that up by making his international debut in Glasgow when Michael O'Neill's side take on the Scots at Hampden Park. Paddy McNair has made an impressive breakthrough for Manchester United this season at the back . The 19-year-old was forced to pull out of his first involvement with the national team last October due to injury, while he was an unused substitute a month later as the Irish lost 2-0 away to Romania. But he is expected to finally pull on the green jersey in the midweek friendly clash that will serve as a warm-up ahead of Sunday's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Finland at Windsor Park. 'It would be a dream come true if that happens,' said the teenage centre-half. 'As a young boy it is a dream to play for your country. 'I went to a few Northern Ireland games when I was very young but I don't remember too much about them. I can remember the atmosphere and hoping that one day I would be out there as well, so if I can do that on Wednesday I will be very proud.' The Northern Irishman competes with the Premier League's newest star Harry Kane at White Hart Lane . Wednesday's match will be just as important to the Scots as it is O'Neill's troops as both countries look to end their long absences from major tournaments by claiming a slot at next year's European Championships in France. While Northern Ireland are just a point off the summit of Group F after taking nine points from the first 12 available, Gordon Strachan's side are very much in the hunt themselves. They sit third in Group D, three points behind leaders Poland and level on seven with Germany and the Republic of Ireland. With that in mind, McNair does not expect an easy introduction to the international game. 'It's going to be tough,' he said. 'It's a game against another home nation and both teams want to win. It won't be a friendly. The 19-year-old has seen his game time limited in recent weeks but has done enough to earn a call-up . 'It's a game we can definitely win, though. We showed in the games in the qualifying group we can beat anybody. 'Scotland have some very good players. I've played against Steven Naismith earlier on this season and you can see why people rate him so highly.' McNair can also expect to come up against another familiar face clad in Dark Blue, with former United midfielder Darren Fletcher likely to line-up for the hosts. The 31-year-old - who quit the Red Devils in January after 12 years to sign for West Brom - played an influential dressing-room role while McNair was making his way through the Old Trafford ranks. Darren Fletcher (right) was influential in helping McNair settle into the United dressing room before he left . And the youngster happily admits he owes the four-time Premier League winner a huge debt of gratitude. 'Darren really helped me a lot and have to thank him a lot for that,' said McNair. 'When I first broke into the team he gave me a lot of advice and really did help me settle in. 'When you come through at Manchester United, it is such a big club with so much pressure on you. 'Darren was in the same position I'm in now at one stage so he would often come up to me before games and have a word to make sure my head was on right. 'Darren is a great player and I'm very happy to see him back playing regularly with West Brom.' Louis van Gaal took a risk on McNair when he had a shortage of defenders and was rewarded for his trust . In the 13 games McNair has racked for Van Gaal's side this term, he has done enough to leave the Dutchman so impressed that he reckons the Ballyclare youth could be a mainstay of the United line-up for the next decade. But McNair himself is trying not to look too far ahead. He said: 'I don't think I will really realise how good a season I have had until the end of the season when I look back at it, but so far I'm very happy. 'Am I surprised at how quickly things have gone this year? Yeah a little bit. 'Sometimes you just need a bit of luck to get your chance.

Frank Leon, 16, said his teacher left to unlock Mrs Jacobson's classroom and he heard 'screaming, crying,' he told the LA Times. 'It freaked the hell out of me.' He added that his teacher was screaming 'Oh my God, oh my God!' Captain Steve Concialdi, from the Orange County Fire Authority, said the teacher took her life sometime before 8.40am. According to the police official, students who found the victim initially arrived to a locked classroom. After the two students were let inside by another teacher, the three found the teacher and helped cut her down from the ceiling. Responding paramedics found her lying on the classroom floor suffering from cardiac arrest, and performed CPR but were unable to revive Mrs Jacobson. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Following the tragic event, many students have paid tribute to Mrs Jacobson on social media. 'We love you Mrs Jacobson,' wrote one student on Twitter. 'You'll never be forgotten.' Another, Mitch Brick, posted a photo of a sunset as he wrote: 'Mrs Jacobson has taught me so much about photography, much love sent out to her, rest in peace. 'Mrs Jacobson told me that to be a good photographer, you need to get creative and think outside the box.' And Amber Guttilla said: 'For those who did not know Mrs Jacobson, there was not a teacher on this planet who cared more for her students. 'Her compassion knew no bounds and she always put us first. Please don't get caught up in the news stories that will only remember her for her final decision. You are so loved Mrs J.' Assistant Superintendent Candy Plahy said the students who saw the hanging scene are being closely monitored and provided special counseling. 'These are kids who were particularly close to this teacher,' said Plahy. 'Coming in and finding your teacher is no longer alive is traumatic. They need support.' Mrs Jacobson's classroom door was locked but a picture of the smiling brunette was placed out front along with notes and flowers. Plahy said the classroom is expected to remain closed for the rest of the year.", "answer": ["Jillian Jacobson, 31, spoke to students about 2011 suicide of her father, Richard Prisbey, 55; told one class suicide is not answer to problems .\nShe taught photography at El Dorado High School in Placentia, California .\nNo one could point to any recent warning signs that she was distressed .\nStudents found her in locked classroom hanging as they arrived for school .\nJacobson was married and lived with her 34-year-old husband in Anaheim .\nOn Monday night, 500 students held candlelit vigil for Mrs Jacobson .\nHer classroom will remain closed until end of school year .\nFor confidential support on suicide matters call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1-800-273-8255 or see www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org for details ."], "label": "SUM"}

Admittedly, the survey focuses most on established and emerging business-focused cities and those with financial centres. 'Taking a short or long-term work assignment to a new country is both an exciting and challenge experience for employees and their families,' says Slagin Parakatil, Principal at Mercer. 'Cultures, societies and comparatively different climates, as well as political instability, high crime rates and poor infrastructure can be difficult to navigate and settle down in.

{"question": "More than half of young adults in Los Angeles can fluently speak a language other than English, despite the fact that the city's percentage of foreign born residents is decreasing. Fifty-seven per cent of those aged 18 to 34, in LA spoke a language other than English at home, beating out Miami which had 55 per cent and San Jose with 54 per cent. Roughly a quarter of the 'Millenial' generation nationwide uses another language, according to the American Community Survey. A map of young adults' ability to speak a language other than English uses dark red for counties where more than 40 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds communicate in a foreign language at home, and lighter shades of pink for smaller proportions of the population . Roughly 60 per cent of LA city residents age five and older speak a language other than English, with Spanish the most popular language among them. In addition to a large number of Latino immigrants, Los Angeles also has large Middle Eastern, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European communities. However, the proportion of foreign-born adults in Los Angeles has actually decreased 9 percentage points to a little less than a third since 1990, and a large number of the Millenials with foreign language skills are thought to be bilingual. The rise in bilingualism is probably caused by children continuing to speak their parents' tongues in addition to English, according to Voice of America. UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa said that the children and grandchildren of immigrants historically stopped learning to speak the same language of their ancestors, but that there has been a 'sea change in the last ten years'. California has seen a growing percentage of its young adults speaking foreign languages (bars in blue) since the 1980s. The US as a whole (pink bars) has also seen its rate increase at a slower pace . Hinojosa said that languages beyond Spanish, second and third-generation immigrants will be encouraged to keep knowledge of Mandarin and other languages. The American Community Survey collected data between 2009 and 2013 and found that 23.3 per cent of the population was between 18 and 34 years old, a fall from 30 per cent in 1980. Data showed that the generation is less likely to be married and more likely to have gone to college than three decades ago, as well as more likely to speak a foreign language. Areas that showed the highest rates for speaking something other than English were near the US-Mexico border in California and Texas. New Jersey was found to be the third most likely state for a young adult to speak a foreign language at home. West Virginia ranked last for the statistic with 3.63 per cent and Middlesborough, Kentucky, was the metro with the lowest percentage of young adults who could speak a foreign language with 0.034. In contrast to Los Angeles, many US cities and states have seen significant increases in their foreign-born populations. The United States as a whole saw its estimated foreign-born population decline 0.4 percentage points from 2000 to the American Community Survey. US: 25 per cent . Atlanta: 22.5 . Boston: 28.1 .

In addition to Tesla, most of the world's automakers sell or are developing electric cars. The Virgin firm could take on Elon Musk's Tesla electric car firm, according to Branson. There are also signs Apple may be working on an electric car and Google is developing a car that can drive itself. However, broader acceptance of electric cars has been held back by the premium consumers must pay for the technology and fears about the driving range of an all-electric vehicle.

{"question": "The world’s first roller-skating artist has says she wants to reinvigorate traditional Chinese art for the next generation - by painting with wheels instead of a pen. Tian Haisu’s latest painting, ‘Blood-Lane-Line’ has gone on exhibition in the California College of Arts, The People's Daily Online has reported. The artist has ditched the calligraphy pen, which has been used for more than a thousand years in traditional Chinese painting, for a pair of skates, after being inspired by her favourite sport, ice skating.

{"question": "They are known as some of nature's most reclusive predators, and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the Czech Republic. Peeking out from behind a tree, the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer Jiri Michal as he tried to capture it on film. The amusing game of peek-a-boo took place in Vysoka, a small village in the country's hilly east, while the seven-year-old male owl was out hunting. Surprise: A great grey owl pokes it head out from behind a tree as Jiri Michal, 34, a senior engineer and photographer, captures the bird of prey on film . Playing games: Mr Michal, who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one, said he wasn't sure what the bird was doing, but it appeared to be playing a game with him . Mr Michal, 34, of Pilsen, Czech Republic, said: 'I wasn't sure what this mischievous owl was doing, however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me. 'Owls are definitely my favourite birds. They have amazing eyes and are always pleasure to photograph.' Mr Michal said he had been photographing the birds for three hours when he spotted this one roughly 20ft away. He added: 'This owl was not in the mood to play for too long, and straight after I took these pictures he flew off. 'I'm forever thinking up new ideas for what to photograph and I love nature as a whole. From the smallest insects to the larger birds and mammals, they must all be protected.' The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length, and lives in northern America, Canada, and northern Europe. Despite owl's reputation as night hunters, great grey owls often seek out prey during the day, perching high in branches and using their excellent hearing and eyesight to track down prey. Now you see me: The great grey owl is the largest species of owl, measuring up to two and a half feet in length. Despite the animal's reputation for being nocturnal, this species often hunts during the day . Youngster: Mr Michal believes the owl was a male, and was around seven years old, making it relatively young. Captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old . Their large face, and two disc-shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes, act as satellite dishes, filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers. Their hearing is so acute that, during the winter months, the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts, listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath. Their large, soft feathers and slow, deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move, so as not to scare their prey away. Once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow, they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out. While the birds are not migratory, they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce.", "answer": ["Jiri Michal, 34, spotted owl while walking in park in west Czech Republic .\nAnimal seemed to be playing game with him while hopping around a tree .\nGreat grey owls can reach more than two feet long and hunt in daylight ."], "label": "SUM"}

If they are on Twitter you block them,’ she said. She explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly ‘binned’. The weather presenter is divorced from Jimmy Kirkwood, her husband of 25 years. But her new partner, whose identity is unknown, takes her legions of male admirers in his stride. She said: ‘My boyfriend is used to it. He just thinks it is funny. He does not take it seriously which is probably just as well.’ The broadcaster herself has taken a light-hearted approach to live TV slip-ups. Last year she battled on despite accidently ‘clicking her clicker’ twice, revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as ‘Town name’. Speaking about her live gaffes, Mrs Kirkwood explained: ‘We can’t see the weather map behind us. Sometimes the map and town doesn’t pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times. You just have to get on with it.’ The glamorous weather presenter said she receives fan mail from enthusiastic older men who would send the explicit pictures in the post . And is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities. ‘People do blame me for bad weather, definitely,’ she revealed. ‘And also people’s expectations are high. People wanted to see snow this year. Some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere.’ She believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession. ‘More and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather. It is good as we offer a load of experience,’ she said.

'If you can do it whether you are a man or a woman, then you can do it. We have got brilliant weather men as much as we have weather women.

Tech blogger Kenneth Tsang extracted all the movies and TV shows on offer in each country and put them in a spreadsheet, finding 1,116 titles in Australia compared with 8,499 in the U.S. A Netflix spokesman said the libraries vary from country to country, adding that they change every day. 'Our aim in Australia is not to replicate the American library,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Netflix has officially launched in Australia but its local offering carries 7,000 fewer titles than its U.S. version . 'As our library grows, we're collecting data and we can tailor our content as we spend more time in market because we understand what Australians are watching.' The spokesman added that content distribution deals prevented Netflix from carrying certain titles in Australia. 'That's purely down to distribution rights, many programs get snapped up by other services. 'Our goal is to work towards a global model, when that happens we will be negotiating rights on a global scale.' Mr Tsang also found that Netflix has 693 titles available only to Australian viewers. On Monday Netflix officially outlined its pricing scheme, and confirmed  House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black would be among its key TV shows on offer. The service launches on Tuesday charging $8.99 per month for a single screen (standard definition), $11.99 for two screens (high definition) and $14.99 for ultra definition on four screens.

{"question": "A trusted church treasurer stole £90,000 to fund her online gambling habit, then pretended to be ill to escape justice. Nicola Holding was described as a 'pillar of the community' for her role at St Boniface's church and pre-school in Plymouth, Devon. But she was secretly siphoning off money from church funds and spending it on herself, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Holding, 50, pleaded guilty to fraud two years ago, but repeatedly failed to turn up to be sentenced, blaming a variety of serious illnesses. Jailed: Nicola Holding has been sentenced to prison for stealing from the church where she was treasurer . Yesterday she was finally sentenced to two and a half years in prison after arriving at court in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets. She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes. Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen £90,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just £24,000. She said £7,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and £6,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school. In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow said:” 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.”' Victims: The congregation at St Boniface's church in Plymouth were betrayed by the fraud, a court heard . He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home. Jo Martin, defending, said: “'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.” ' She said Holding would find prison life '‘extraordinarily difficult'’ because of her ailments. Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes. 'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said. 'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults. “'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave. Nicola was trusted implicitly.”' Holding was wheeled out of court to begin her sentence at a prison which can cater for her medical condition.", "answer": ["Nicola Holding was a 'pillar of the community' for role at Plymouth church .\nBut she stole £90,000 and spent it on web gambling and Ikea furniture .\nClaimed she was too ill to go to court for sentencing for two years .\nHolding, 50, has now been sentenced to 30 months in jail for fraud ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Branko Loncar, 55, won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder . A man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in Britain – after judges refused to extradite him. Branko Loncar, 55, has won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder, despite committing further crimes, including an assault, while living in London. He earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee Croatia because of anti-Serb discrimination – and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting. Last week’s High Court ruling is a sharp reminder that while the Government talks of ejecting foreign criminals, in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here. Loncar, who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in Britain with his two sons in 1999, made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away. In any case, his lawyers claimed, she died as a result of hanging herself, not because of the 14 bullets he ‘accidentally’ fired into her defenceless body. A Croatian court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence, sentenced him to four years in prison, and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from Britain. His lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds, arguing that he had a new Serbian ‘partner’ in Britain – who actually lives a hundred miles away – and that he now had grandchildren in London. And last week British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free here, after ruling it ‘oppressive’ to send him back to prison in Croatia after so long. He was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife. Speaking in broken English to the Daily Mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable Camden in North London, Loncar said he had every right to remain in Britain, adding: ‘Croatia is dangerous – they still want me there.’ The case began in 1994, amid the chaos of the Balkan wars, when Loncar, an ethnic Serb and former soldier in the Yugoslavian army, lived with his wife Mirjana and two sons in the village of Ostrovo. The area was declared part of a Serbian republic but was also claimed by Croatia. UK court documents note: ‘After a quarrel with his wife Mirjana, she went out of the house, stood on a ladder, took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself. As she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious, the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body. ‘The cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant’s gun. The defendant was charged with murder.’ The subsequent trial – by a Serbian court – heard that Loncar had fired 14 shots from his handgun ‘causing a number of injuries’. Last week, British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free in the UK, by ruling in the High Court (pictured) that it would be ‘oppressive’ to send him back to prison in Croatia . He told the court ‘that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder, he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away, but did not know in which direction.’ After a single pathologist claimed Mrs Loncar had already died of strangulation before being shot, he was initially cleared of murder. In 1999 he then flew to England with his children and successfully claimed asylum, saying that his ethnic Serbian children were discriminated against by Croatians at school – but also complaining of ‘local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife’. While he began a life on benefits here, Croatia’s supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial, with Loncar’s village now a part of Croatia, and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder. Four doctors said Mrs Loncar was still alive when her husband shot her. He was given a four-year prison sentence on the grounds that he ‘had an intention to kill’. Croatia, a member of the European Union, some years later sought Loncar’s extradition, and in 2006 British police arrested him. A UK court swiftly rejected the request, noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife. But in 2014 he was arrested again, and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the High Court in London. Last week’s High Court judgment in Loncar’s favour, by judges Lord Justice Aiken and Mrs Justice Popplewell, the conclusion of the long legal battle, noted: ‘The offence for which the extradition of Mr Loncar is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one. Moreover, Mr Loncar has not led a blameless life as a British citizen. ‘He has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013. Nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite Mr Loncar by reason of the passage of time.’ The ruling was also sharply critical of the Croatian legal system, and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago. And in reference to the Human Rights Act’s ‘right to a family life’ clause, judges said Loncar had ‘been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006, although they do not live together’. Far from living together, the Daily Mail has discovered that ‘partner’ helping provide him with a ‘family life’ to maintain here is an ethnic Serb born in Britain and living 100 miles from him in Leicester.", "answer": ["Branko Loncar, 55, moved to UK after being cleared of murdering his wife .\nHe won asylum by claiming he fled country due to anti-Serb discrimination .\nBut Croatian court convicted him in his absence during a retrial in 2000 .\nCroatia asked for his extradition from UK in 2005 but lawyers fought move .\nThey said he had right to family life with new Serbian partner in the UK .\nLoncar continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault .\nHigh Court has now ruled it  'oppressive' to send Loncar back after so long ."], "label": "SUM"}

After dismissing Ireland for 249 with an over to spare when their spinners established a stranglehold on the top-order batting, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan played themselves in for a token couple of overs.

Those were the only times the Irish bowlers looked like taking a wicket and the duo took the score to 174 when Sharma chopped medium pacer Stuart Thompson on to his stumps and was out for 64 from 66 balls. With the Indian supporters making a tremendous din, Dhawan took a single to complete his eighth one-day century from 84 balls with five sixes but was then caught off the following ball he faced from Thompson. Virat Kohli (44 not out) and Ajinkya Rahane (33 not out) took their team to victory with 13.1 overs to spare. Porterfield elected to bat on a warm afternoon before a capacity crowd of 11,000 packed into a picturesque ground in New Zealand's fourth largest city and all seemed set fair for the Irish when the captain and Paul Stirling put on 89 for the first wicket from 15 overs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni turned to his spinners and Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina responded by first frustrating then dismissing the Irish batsmen who found boundaries hard to come by after the initial flurry.

{"question": "There were famous faces in the best seats in the house as optimism over a new era abounded. John Greig, officially the Greatest Ever Ranger, was by Dave King’s side in the director’s box in a highly symbolic return to Ibrox. He was joined by one of the club’s greatest ever managers, Walter Smith, and John Brown, who can lay claim to some of the greatest ever declamations against the ousted boardroom regime. Rangers midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, celebrates putting the home side ahead at Ibrox . Young Queen of the South striker Aidan Smith (centre) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller . The greatness, somewhat predictably, stopped at the white lines of the pitch. This ramshackle group of players looked like they might just let the feelgood factor flourish when Newcastle loanee Haris Vuckic put them ahead with 12 minutes remaining. There would not, however, be the delicious irony of one of Mike Ashley’s men allowing King and Co a victory to savour in their first home match since seizing control. All the failings that have left the Ibrox side in the midst of a Championship play-off scrap they may well not win came to the fore as 17-year-old Aidan Smith – making just his second senior appearance - equalised for Queens eight minutes later. In truth, it was a point they more than merited. Jeers rang out at the final whistle as supporters who flocked back to Ibrox to financially support the new board digested yet another on-field setback. The grim sequence of results now reads as just one win in their last seven outings. For King and his associates, the question of what can be done to lift a desperately flagging season remains highly pertinent. Discussions with caretaker manager Kenny McDowall will have to determine whether he continues or whether an alternative interim appointment is made for the remainder of the campaign. This was not the first time this season that Queens had found themselves featuring in a significant day in the Rangers saga. Back on December 12, their comprehensive 2-0 victory at Palmerston Park became almost an addendum to news that Ally McCoist had handed in his notice. For the visiting support inside the Dumfries ground, it was yet another bewildering development to try and digest. Rangers legend John Greig was in the stands at Ibrox for Tuesday night's Scottish Championship clash . Events tumbled even quicker from then, through McCoist’s gardening leave, an AGM, crisis loan offers and boardroom resignations, finally reaching the regime change arrived at with last Friday’s EGM. Somewhere in the middle of the jumble was the SFA’s refusal, on Christmas Eve of all days, to allow Ashley to increase his shareholding. It was one of several, crucial turning points on the exceptionally winding road towards a fresh start for a club bruised and battered over the previous four years. The desperation of supporters to grasp this moment, for those who stayed away to return to supporting their team, was palpable. Some had purchased half-season tickets in the wake of the EGM, despite some of the included matches having already passed. Last night, routes around Ibrox were congested in fashion often unfamiliar this season. The stadium wasn’t full, but the 35,018 here was still the highest crowd recorded since the opening day of the season. Anyone purchasing a programme on their way in was greeted by a cover showing King with his arms around John Gilligan and Paul Murray, happily posing within the trophy room. Enthusiasm was everywhere. The question, of course, was how long it would last when confronted by the paucity of the Rangers team. Given the boos that rang out at half-time, the answer could be given as approximately 45 minutes. Fresh from a dispiriting 0-0 draw with Cowdenbeath at the weekend, McDowall’s side had actually made a pretty positive start – as if feeding off the renewed energy. Nicky Law picked out Nicky Clark with a nice cutback and the striker drilled narrowly wide from the edge of the area. Not long after, Clark was unable to generate sufficient power or direction in a header. Yet their best chance of the opening period fell to the other front man in McDowall’s 4-4-2. It was woefully spurned. Vuckic fashioned the opportunity by cutting in field to hit a deflected drive that was pushed out by Zander Clark in the Queens goal. Daly looked odds-on to polish things off but spooned the rebound over the bar on the slide. Vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute Bilel Mohsni (left), Nicky Clark and Darren McGregor . Queens had shown a nice degree of composure in midfield and steadily began to assert themselves. Slowly but surely, the atmosphere changed. When Law was robbed on the fringe of the area by Kevin Holt after 34 minutes, the first real roar of frustration arrived. By that point, the visitors could already have been ahead. Lee McCulloch missed a defensive header to allow Gavin Reilly in behind him. He picked out Michael Paton, whose neatly-struck effort beat Lee Robinson but rebounded off the goalkeeper’s right-hand post. Ibrox heaved a sigh of relief. But it was not the last first-half scare. When Robinson was forced into evasive action to deny a fine Iain Russell strike, the loose ball spun towards Reilly. He couldn’t adjust his body quickly enough to head below the bar from around six yards out. Daly looped one wide from a Lee Wallace cross after the restart but that wasn’t the signal for a Rangers bombardment. A change was needed if a resolute and sparky Queens side weren’t going to spoil the party. One finally arrived from McDowall in the 65th minute when young Andy Murdoch was replaced by the even younger Tom Walsh. The 18-year-old at least injected a little more pace and energy to proceedings. It seemed as though Rangers had finally sneaked a winner after 78 minutes. Vuckic got a touch to a ball delivered from the left before Clark practically stumbled into it. It broke back to the Newcastle loanee who calmly angled a shot into the far corner of the net. This is, however, a team riven with weaknesses. And they were exposed yet again when Queens claimed a leveller they deserved with just four minutes to play. Bilel Mohsni – just on four minutes earlier after Lee Wallace was hurt – was typically wayward with a bungled attempt at a clearance that looped to Daniel Carmichael. He delivered into the middle, where Robinson expertly saved from Paton. There was, though, to be no denying teenager Smith, who was left with a simple finish into an exposed net.", "answer": ["Haris Vuckic put Rangers ahead against Queen of the South on Tuesday .\nQueen of the South striker Aidan Smith scored late equaliser .\nRangers legend John Greig was at Ibrox for the Championship fixture ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Jerusalem (CNN)Either Benjamin Netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in Israeli history and beyond, or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election. Polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire, with Netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union party. Only four days before the election, polls showed Herzog taking a four-seat lead into the final weekend before the election. Exit polls on the night of the election showed Netanyahu had closed the gap. The polls suggested he was in a dead heat, with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties. Then came the results. Not more polls or surveys, but actual counts from the ballot boxes. Netanyahu wasn't in a fight for his political life after all. He was the clear winner, running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government. Although the results are unofficial, it seems almost certain that Netanyahu will remain the Israeli prime minister. Avi Degani, a pollster, professor at Tel Aviv University and president of the Geocartography Knowledge Group, saw very different results from his own polls. He never anticipated a Zionist Union victory. Instead, he says, he always saw Likud holding a lead. The mistake that others made, according to Degani, was in the methodology. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" he said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- Tel Aviv, better-educated, more participants in this kind of conversation. And people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote Likud, I think, are poorly represented.\" \"I have tested sometimes at the same night, doing by telephone as I do always -- and very specifically geographically, and very well-weighted and very well, having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time I did on the Internet. And I got results which are very, very different.\" But Mina Tzemach, the polling expert for CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel, suggests Netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap \"like a magician,\" using the election polls as his final trick. \"The polls showed that they are going to lose. It gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians. Netanyahu used it,\" said Tzemach. \"Many voted what we call strategic voting. They did not vote to the party that is their first preference, but they voted for the Likud.\" Likud voters did not participate in exit polls, according to Tzemach, and that skewed the results, leading many to believe that Herzog had tied Netanyahu. \"We had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former Soviet Union,\" explained Tzemach. \"In these ballots, more than 30% did not participate in our polls, and they are Likud supporters.\" Another factor that may have worked in Netanyahu's favor was his Likud party cannibalizing votes from other right-wing parties. In the days before the election, Netanyahu moved to the political right, making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties, such as Naftali Bennett's Jewish Home party and Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party. During the weekend before the election, Netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square. He continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election. His most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution. \"Anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel,\" he said in a television interview. \"This is the true reality that was created here in the last few years.\" In 2009, in a speech known as the Bar Ilan speech, Netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution, saying, \"Let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions. Israel is committed to international agreements, and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations. I say to the Palestinians: We want to live with you in peace, quiet, and good neighborly relations.\" Tzemach estimates that Likud took four seats from Jewish Home and two more seats from Yachad, a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Exit polls in Israel have been wrong before. In the most recent elections in 2013, exit polls showed Yair Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the Knesset. But when the final results were tallied, Lapid won 19 seats, becoming a major player in the government. This time, the unexpected surprise worked in Netanyahu's favor, turning the campaign race into an election night rout. Likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats, but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee based on 99% of the vote. Netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before. In the 1996 elections, early results showed the Labor Party's Shimon Peres as the winner, but as more results came in, Netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1% of the votes. Degani said this election reveals the truth behind Israeli politics. \"This last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left. We have only right and extreme right, which is not nice sometimes. And in the right, you have the Likud mostly, and in the Likud, you have mostly Netanyahu.\"", "answer": ["Polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire, with Netanyahu in a virtual tie with Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union party .\nBut actual results show Netanyahu running away with the election .\nPossible causes: Poll methodology, Netanyahu's last-minute turn to the right ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "England will kick off Saturday's game knowing precisely what they need to do to win the Six Nations and take huge momentum into the World Cup. They had a similar chance a year ago — although they didn’t play last — but blew it badly in Rome. The common language of coaches in this position is ‘let’s win the game first,’ but that is nonsense. This is not about beating France, it is about winning the title. They need a clear game plan to maximise points difference. Nobody remembers who comes second. Chris Robshaw's England will know exactly what they have to do to win the Six Nations when they kick off . Luther Burrell breaks with the ball during the England captain's run at Twickenham . It is tempting to think England must throw caution to the wind and play a wild, attacking game. But if they get ahead of themselves and try to run up a big score early they could come horribly unstuck. This is not a bad French team — in fact I have never really seen a bad French team as they do have so much talent available. They don’t look comfortable on or off the field but the French have a habit of performing under pressure and they’re capable of beating England. Throughout this week, I would have gone through match scenarios with my captain, the scrum-halves and the fly-halves, discussing what decision we’d make depending on how many points we need in the match. That would then be presented to the whole team so everyone is on message. England's players gather as head coach Stuart Lancaster looks on during the captain's run . Jonathan Joseph passes the ball during the England captain's run ahead of the game with France . Lancaster must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title . If England need a big score, Chris Robshaw and the half-backs will face big decisions from the first minute. I hope Stuart Lancaster has made it clear to the players this week exactly how the day will pan out in terms of timings. As soon as the early games finish, the results should be up on the changing-room wall. The amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big, bold type. This is the day for real detail and no surprises, and finding out which players can really perform under pressure. England should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in, especially after the hiding they received in Dublin. With the games falling as they do, I wouldn’t set out any directives for the team about watching them or not — it should be every individual’s decision. Personally, I would like to watch as much as possible; if nothing else, it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes. Some of the players may want to watch the Wales v Italy game while others won’t. They’ll be warming up while the Scotland v Ireland game is being played so there’s no question of them watching that, but I’d let the players know I would be putting the score from the Ireland game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what’s required of them. That can be broken down into six very clear areas. 1 Build the score . It sounds easy, but it’s critical. France are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to Twickenham. The best way to create pressure is to lead throughout. So England must try to ensure they take the lead early and force France to chase the game. They must take every penalty that is offered — if the referee, say, gives an advantage, decline it and take the points. Take three points from drop-goal opportunities — never leave their 22 without points. Joseph scores England's first try against Scotland and they must build a score against France . This game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes, even if you don’t score tries until later in the game. If opportunities arise, we must take them, something we failed to do against Scotland. 2 Maintain discipline . England must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half. The contact area and scrum will be key and England cannot afford to gift France easy points. Scrum-half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens and England must not allow France to have the ball at the breakdown. Yellow or red cards must be seen as a total disaster, and every player must take full responsibility to control himself in every aspect of the game. Scrum half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens . 3 Keep the ball in play . The speed of the ball and the speed and variety of the restarts are absolutely critical. I want to see quick, pre-called line-outs and the ball in and out of the scrum quickly to avoid the risk of giving penalties away at the back of it. If the line-out isn’t secure, there’s nothing wrong with taking the tap penalty. Keep the tempo up because this massive French side will not want to be moved around. George Ford passes the ball and England must keep the ball in play as much as possible . Also, to score maximum points, you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time. Every time the ball’s out of play, it is not only time but points ticking away. England must also employ an exciting restart policy. Every kick-off must be done with the aim of getting the ball back. We need variety so we can kick left, right or down the middle but we must get it back. 4 Kick well, chase hard . This is a huge test of England’s tactical kicking game, which I’m not sure is as good as it needs to be yet. In the 2003 World Cup semi-final, I picked Mike Catt at No 12 ahead of Mike Tindall because he had a superior kicking game. France will believe they can get at George Ford so Mike Brown needs to support his kicking game. Mike Brown needs to support Ford's kicking game and limit the up-and-unders . I’d limit the up-and-unders and box kicks, too, as they are too much of a lottery. Ford, Youngs and Brown need to look deep and hit the green stuff. Field position gave Jonny Wilkinson the opportunity to get three drop goals as England won that semi 24-7 against a French team who were favourites to beat us. 5 Half-Time . The message needs to be that this is now a game of 40 minutes. You can’t change what’s happened in the first half but you can learn. They’ll know exactly what is needed and the team and tactics can change if needs be. The bench can then be used to identify areas of French weakness and attack them. England must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes . Understand, France are currently the best defensive team in the tournament, having only conceded two tries. Patience will be a key word, but tries will come as long as we are playing the game at real pace. 6 Keep your best men on . Matches are won in the last 30 minutes, not the first 30, and I’d always look to have my strongest side on the field at the end of the game. The key is not to bring any player on unless he is going to improve the team. I still believe Danny Cipriani can be a trump card. Will Lancaster dare opt for a Ford-Cipriani-Joseph combination if the game calls for it? You can score two tries in the last five minutes; it only takes 20 seconds to score. Danny Cipriani can be England's trump card coming off the bench . I’d expect England to win — then it becomes about by how much. I just feel this French side is better than everyone is giving them credit for, and I’m very surprised Lancaster has not picked a specialist second-row on the bench. It’s a massive gamble as Courtney Lawes and Geoff Parling have a history of injuries, potentially leaving Nick Easter to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row. This is a hugely exciting day of rugby. People have questioned the staggered kick-off times but for me it makes the day unbelievably exciting and is brilliant for fans watching at home. It is a massive day for Lancaster and his team. They need this championship more than the others. They can’t afford another bad day at the office.", "answer": ["England play France in the final game of the Six Nations and will know exactly what they have to do to win the tournament .\nEngland must aim to win the Six Nations title and not just beat France .\nEngland were in a similar position last year and failed to win the title ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "China has been rocked by a hard-hitting film made by a former state TV news anchor which links her baby's tumour to the country's terrible air pollution. Chai Jing's investigative documentary - which has already attracted unprecedented attention from the country's officials - explores the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells the story of her daughter, who was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The 39-year-old goes on to report how a number of newborn babies in China have contracted pneumonia without even leaving home. Scroll down for video . Young victims: Chai Jing, 39, has made a hard-hitting film, exploring the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state . Motherly love: In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells how her daughter was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013 . The film also features an interview with Wang Huiqin (pictured), 6, who lives in highly industrialised Shanxi Province and says she has never seen stars or blue skies . Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. It has already been watched by some 200million people and has sparked a firestorm of public criticism over the government's failure to act on the issue in a timely manner. In the 144-minute film, Ms Chai, a former anchor at China Central Television, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, tells how she made the documentary to tell her daughter 'what is smog, where smog comes from and what we shall do with it'. She explains how she found herself pregnant in January 2013, when 25 provinces and cities in China were blanketed by heavy smog. She then gave birth in October 2013, when her daughter had already been diagnosed with a benign tumour. The diagnosis led to Ms Chai quitting her job  at the beginning of last year so she could focus on taking care of her daughter. It was during that period that she began making the film, entitled Under the Dome, she explains. Enveloped: Most cities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai (pictured), face serious air pollution issues . Price for industrialisation: China burns a large amount of petroleum and coal, two major causes of pollution . The film was distributed to various video websites in China on February 28. It received 117 million views in the first 24 hours, according to Tencent. Ms Chai's daughter is no longer unwell. But she says in the film that she only took her daughter outside when air quality in Beijing was marked excellent or good. The rest of the time she had to lock her daughter at home 'like a prisoner', she claims. She adds that 175 days during 2014 were graded as polluted in Beijing. The film also includes an interview with a six-year-old girl, Wang Huiqin, who lives in Shanxi Province, a heavily industrialised area in central China. The girl tells Ms Chai in the interview how she has never seen stars, blue skies or white clouds in her life. Stardom: Ms Chai is a highly recognised anchor and investigative journalist in China. She is also a best-selling writer . Controversy: Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected . China's cities are often hit by heavy pollution – in the form of smog – caused by burning a large amount of petroleum and coal. The film has already been widely backed by the Chinese public, as well as a number of officials. Chen Jining, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection in China, was quoted in an article on People's Daily as saying: 'I want to thank her. She has wakened up the public to pay attention to the environment from a public health perspective. 'I think (she is) worth our respect.' Self-protection: A girl puts a mask on her dog in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province, during a smog attack .

And Gao Mingyong, a senior media commentator in China, wrote on ifeng.com: 'Under the Dome is the best example of self-initiated media which can represent the logic of the internet, but its significance is far more than this.' Ms Chai financed the making of the film by herself which cost $160,000.

Naturally Kane-mania has kicked in, but the trio of players who started in forward positions for England are creating a bit of a stir. ‘Europe will fear us now,’ declared Wayne Rooney and although it was a little optimistic, the front three are moving in the right direction. Roy Hodgson calls Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck his ‘five yard furies’, two players capable of causing chaos in opposition defences. With Rooney alongside them, they are flourishing. This was undoubtedly one of Sterling’s best games in an England shirt: he read Rooney’s pass to score and later sent in the left wing cross for Harry Kane’s debut goal. Raheem Sterling stole in at the near post to tuck the ball home for England's third against Lithuania . Sterling is forming a impressive understanding with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck . Sterling’s double nutmeg on Tomas Mikuckis and Marius Zaliukas, all completed in the same 18th minute move, was outrageous. Lionel Messi did something similar to James Milner during Barcelona’s totalising of Manchester City in the Champions League and the world went into meltdown. Sterling likes the trick, too. Welbeck was also one of England’s most prominent players, an increasing influence on this team as they head towards Euro 2016. He has the trust of his manager. Unfortunately Welbeck will probably miss the game against Italy because of a knee injury and Sterling is heading back to Liverpool for an injection on a long-standing toe injury. 2 SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT . England dropped to 17th in the FIFA world rankings earlier this month and yet the support for the national team is unwavering, even on a Friday night and against opposition as poor as Lithuania. England supporters were even singing ‘Roy Hodgson’s barmy army’ after Wayne Rooney had scored his 47th goal for his country against Lithuania. This was close to a full house at the national stadium for a routine victory, England’s fifth successive win in this qualification campaign. England fans flocked to Wembley on Friday night despite the latest in a long line of mediocre opposition . The atmosphere remains a problem and the FA would do well to change the playlist to whip up the Wembley crowd before the two teams emerge from the tunnel before kick-off. They did at least turn to old favourite Carnaval de Paris, but what’ s wrong with a bit of tub-thumping by playing some of the other terrace anthems, such as New Order’s World in Motion and the Lightning Seeds’ Three Lions? Bring them back. 3 PLAN FOR THE FUTURE . Roy Hodgson would have offered his resignation if England lost their opening group game against Switzerland last September, but they emerged with a positive 2-0 victory from that tricky night in Basle. Suddenly this emerging team has momentum, stringing together victories and establishing a winning mentality in that England dressing room. Roy Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at Euro 2016 . We have seen this before, with England unbeaten in their last two qualifying campaigns for Euro 2012 and World Cup 2014. Sadly, we know what happened the moment England ran into some opposition with real pedigree and class. Hodgson must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at the tournament next summer. England have plenty of possession in games against Lithuania, but will they dominate territorially against world champions Germany, hosts France or Spain? Hodgson, who has the backing of his players in this qualification campaign, must plan accordingly if the national team is to avoid a repeat of the performance in Brazil. 4 NEW BOYS SHINE . The options appear to be increasing for Hodgson as this team beds in for the qualifying campaign, selecting a starting eleven with players from eight different clubs (Manchester City, Southampton, Everton, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Aston Villa). Manchester United and Liverpool are well represented on the field, but props to right back Nathaniel Clyne and central midfielder Fabian Delph for forcing their way into the first team ahead of some established, international players. Delph, who worked hard alongside Michael Carrick and Jordan Henderson in the centre of England’s three man midfield, was denied his first international goal by the brilliance of Giedrius Arlauskis in goal for Lithuania. Clyne is an accomplished player and he has been a breath of fresh air in his opening three games for his country. All three - Slovenia, Scotland and Lithuania - have resulted in victories. Fabian Delph has managed to force his way into the England side ahead of some more established players . 5 TRUE TEST IN TURIN . Roy Hodgson firmly believes that he has put the nightmare of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil behind him, but their next opponents will provide a brutal reminder of the past in their next game. England were beaten 2-1 in Manaus in their opening group game and were out of the tournament after another defeat, against Uruguay in Sao Paulo. On Tuesday, England head to Turin for a prestige friendly against Antonio Conte's side, but much has changed in the Italian camp since the World Cup. Eder (centre) was born in Brazil but now has Italian citizenship and could face England next week . Mario Balotelli, who scored Italy’s 50th minute winner in the Arena de Amazonia on June 15 2014, has been told he will never be selected again under their new coach. Instead Italy, who play Bulgaria on Saturday in a Euro 2014 qualifier, are stitching together a new side under the former Juventus coach. FA chairman Greg Dyke won’t like the look of it, that’s for sure: Palermo forward Franco Vazquez was born in Argentina and Eder, who plays for Sampdoria in Serie A, was born in Brazil. They now have Italian citizenship and are both in the Italy squad. Expect Hodgson and Dyke to have their say when we get to Turin.", "answer": ["Wembley was almost full for England's 4-0 win over Lithunia .\nRaheem Sterling linked well with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck .\nRoy Hodgson must prepare his side for the stiffer tests at Euro 2016 .\nItaly are a different proposition to the side that beat England last summer ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Jailed: Ali Adorus is currently in jail in Ethiopia after being convicted of terrorism offences . This is the Londoner who travelled on 'safari' with evil Islamic State killer Jihadi John. Ali Adorus, 33, travelled to Tanzania in 2009 with Mohammed Emwazi when the pair were held and questioned by security services before being deported. Adorus, who was born in Ethiopia but grew up in London, is currently in an African prison after being convicted of terrorism offences. The married father-of-one was arrested in Ethiopia in January last year. Authorities say he entered the country in 2011 to try to establish Islamic rule through acts of 'terrorism'. Adorus grew up in a council house in north London and it remains unclear how he befriended Emwazi. He is believed to have worked as a security guard after studying at college in east London. Adorus was also known to the British intelligence services and received support from the controversial human rights group Cage, according to The Times. Along with German national Marcel Schrodl, the three were questioned by security services in Tanzania and later by British intelligence officers in Amsterdam and Dover. They complained about their treatment to Cage, who provoked outrage last week after describing Emwazi as ‘extremely kind’ and ‘beautiful young man’. At his trial in Ethiopia, prosecutors said that Adorus was 'accused of trying to unconstitutionally change the government and introduce Islamic government in Ethiopia by terrorism'. But Cage said that he was simply visiting relatives and gave a false confession in Amharic - a language he does not speak - after being 'brutally tortured'. They said that the case 'confirms a worrying pattern of young Britons of East African descent being harassed by MI5 and later ending up tortured in a third country'. He initially faced the death penalty but was then jailed for four-and-a-half years, along with two other British nationals. An anonymous family friend said that Adorus's relatives would not discuss his case in Ethiopia. Friend: Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as the man behind the 'Jihadi John' mask . Neighbours on the estate where he grew up described him as a 'good lad' and said that they found it difficult to believe that he had been jailed. One of his neighbours in London described him as a 'kind, beautiful and innocent human being'. In August, his wife wrote on a support group: 'We will get him home soon, Inshallah!' Following his arrest and detention in Ethiopia, Cage went on to petition the former foreign secretary William Hague and the Ethiopian ambassador over concerns that Adorus had not received a fair trial. In a letter on the Change petition site, they said: 'I have seen information according to which he was severely tortured in Maekelawi police station. 'According to an urgent appeal made to the United Nations, Ali Adorus was brutally beaten, handcuffed behind his back for an extended period of time, beaten on his hands with heavy wires, hooded, given electric shocks and denied access to a toilet.' Jihadi John: Mohammed Emwazi was expelled from Tanzania in 2009 for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam along with Adorus . In 2009, Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Emwazi and Schrodl, an Islamic convert who may have used the alias Umar and who described himself as a translator. The trio thought to have approached Cage about their 2009 treatment in Amsterdam, after their deportation from Tanzania. The group reported that they and Emwazi were 'repeatedly harassed' by the Dutch and British authorities. Cage compiled a report in which it accused their interrogators of comparing Muslims and Islam to dogs and terrorism. The group said that Adorus had been told by security service officers that 'our details will be passed to the secret services of the whole world'.", "answer": ["Ali Adorus was questioned alongside Mohammed Emwazi in 2009 .\nPair were detained and deported after raising suspicions for visiting .\nThe 33-year-old was jailed last year in Ethiopia for four-and-a-half years .\nAuthorities say he was hoping to establish Islamic rule through 'terrorism'"], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Juventus travel to face Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night knowing that if they do not score, their German opponents can knock them out with a single goal. So the message is clear: they must attack. Head coach Massimiliano Allegri has spoken out ahead of the game urging his team to show they are far from the side cast as 'boring' that lead Italy's Serie A - and the Italian sport newspapers have reflected the boss' vision. La Gazzetta dello Sport, Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport all call for the nation's champions to attack Dortmund, with a forward line including Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang unlikely to be restricted to an extent that they are unable to score the one goal that could send Dortmund through after Juve's 2-1 home win last month. La Gazzetta dello Sport's: 'Go Juve! The right choice' and Tuttosport's: 'The order of Allegri: Let's attack!' Corriere dello Sport's front page barks out: 'Juve, take Europe' after Massimiliano Allegri's comments . Tuttosport's message is the most resounding, with their front page specifically calling for Juve to attack at the Signal Iduna Park making it clear that in order to qualify, the Old Lady need goals. The paper also calls for Argentine winger Roberto Pereyra to be used in a 4-3-1-2 system by Allegri - who it also reports is set to be offered a new contract. Both Gazzetta and Corriere look to Juventus' talisman, former Manchester City and Manchester United striker, Carlos Tevez. Gazzetta also want to see Pereyra deployed in a 4-3-1-2 behind Tevez and Alvaro Morata in a game that could be worth £6.5million to Juve. Carlos Tevez trains ahead of the last-16 tie, and the Italian papers see him as a key man for Juventus . Paul Pogba takes a moment away from the training session as Juventus look to hold on to their lead . Meanwhile, Corriere calls for the 'class of Tevez and super defence to tackle Klopp'. 'We go into the game with an advantage,' Allegri said ahead of the game. 'We know the difficulties of the task ahead of us, no doubt about it. 'I don't expect it to end 0-0. We need to score at least once and if we could score two goals it would be great.' Allegri believes the game in Dortmund will not end 0-0 and that his side will need to find a way to score . Alvaro Morata hits a pass during training, and Gazzetta dello Sport want him upfront alongside Tevez . The Germans have been improving in recent weeks after a bad first half to the Bundesliga season and have lost none of their last six league games. They are also unbeaten at home in Europe this season although they have lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. 'We have to be ready for the strengths of Dortmund, their speed, their pressure,' the Italian coach added. 'We have to have a technically perfect game and pounce on their weaknesses.'

A southern New Jersey man who is in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy has admitted sexually assaulting a 2-year-old in a separate case. Osvaldo Rivera, 34, pleaded guilty to sexual assault Monday. Under terms of the plea deal, Rivera faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already facing after a jury found him guilty of the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar and the sexual assault of that boy's 12-year-old sister, Amber in September 2012. The sexual assault of the younger child, a 2-year-old boy, was the month before that. The Camden County Prosecutor's Office said DNA evidence submitted to a state database helped link Rivera to the crime. Rivera is scheduled to be sentenced in the toddler assault case April 17. 'Rivera had to be held accountable for the crime he committed against this toddler, regardless of having been previously sentenced to life in prison in another case,' Assistant Prosecutor Christine Shah told Philadelphia Inquirer. In July 2014, a Camden jury found Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations.

At around midnight on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into the Andujar family's home in Camden and attacked then 12-year-old Amber Andujar as she slept on the couch. Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid. The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process. Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help. By the time police arrived on the scene, the brave 6-year-old boy was dead after having his throat slashed.

Emergency responders said the cuts were so deep they could see Amber's vocal cords. She later helped officers locate her rapist by telling them he was known by the nickname ’Popeye’ and lived in a Camden apartment. Police tracked him down to an apartment in the city and found him hiding between an upturned mattress and the wall. According to investigators, during his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing.

Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has admitted he worries that being Labour leader means his sons think he spends too much time on his phone . He made a rare appearance on the school run with Daniel and Samuel and invited the TV cameras along as part of the move to present him as a family man . As part of his profile interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband took his sons to school, but then let slip that he rarely does it. He said: 'It's a huge pleasure to be able to see them during the day, it's a rare treat for me.' Mr Miliband also admitted that he worries about the impact of his job on his sons. He said: 'Yeah I do worry about that, I do worry about that. It's a constant battle and it's a constant thing that I've got to just be conscious of to make sure whatever job I'm doing now and in the future, that I make sure that I make sure that there's that time for them. 'I don't want them looking back and thinking, 'well Dad was never around' 'Dad was always on the phone', I think they probably would say Dad is on the phone a lot but I don't want them thinking you know I was just, I was never there.'

{"question": "The League Cup remains Celtic’s Achilles heel. The Scottish trophy which has eluded them most often. Since beating Saturday's opponents Dundee United in the 1997-98 final, the Parkhead club have won it a further four times. To supporters of smaller, provincial clubs, that would be a form of nirvana. A glorious period of outstanding achievement. Ronny Deila is determined to get his hands on the League Cup after Sunday's final against Dundee United . To Celtic, it’s a source of mild failure. In the same period the club has captured twice as many league titles. And six Scottish Cups The clubs previous two managers, Tony Mowbray and Neil Lennon, didn’t win the League Cup at all and Lennon’s record in cups was a source of occasional unrest. For Ronny Deila, then, the first trophy of his Celtic tenure would be hugely significant. ‘It is something we would remember for the rest of our lives,’ said the Norwegian. ‘Cup finals are big. They are big in Norway and in Scotland and England. This tradition is important.’ Bold and forthright, Deila has publicly pledged to win a Treble. Managers usually play down talk of clean sweeps and banish the very words from their vocabulary. A fatalistic, superstitious streak runs through Scottish football, but Deila isn’t having it. Far from piling pressure on himself or his players, he believes it sets a target to strive for. Celtic expect to win all three domestic trophies every season. Saying so should be no cause for palpitations. ‘I am very calm,’ said Deila with a grin. ‘Maybe too much. Hopefully it will come on Sunday - but we have so many big matches you get used to it. ‘If this had been a small club, the cup final would be totally crazy. It would be all: “Who is going to sit here and what are we going to do with the supporters?” But this club has done it so many times, so it’s very calm. ‘We just prepare for what’s ahead of us and I think we can feel in the atmosphere of the players there is a big game coming up. Again, we can reach one of our targets and that’s important.’ Deila issues instructions to his players during the recent Scottish Cup quarter-final draw with Dundee United . In one sense he is correct. Celtic have been in many cup finals, too many to mention. But he hasn’t. ‘In 2010, Stromsgodset beat a First Division team in the final,’ he recalled. ‘I played in 2001 and won, then lost one in 2002. The cup final is big in Norway, there is only one cup and, like the FA Cup, it’s the last game of the season and is always sold out. ‘I have seen crazy things at the cup final. Things like: “Who is going to sit beside the King?” That’s how it is with small clubs. Not here.’ He believes Celtic are favourites to win because they have the bigger squad. More options. Those options will be diminished if Nir Bitton, an increasingly influential midfielder, fails to overcome a swollen ankle. But Kris Commons is fit again and ready. ‘Kris trained yesterday (Thursday) and looked good,’ reported Deila. ‘Adam Matthews is a bit too early. Bitton will hopefully reach it, though he has still not trained. But he is very determined, so hopefully he will reach it. ‘We will give him until Sunday because he is a very important player. We want him to play and I think he has a good chance.’ That Celtic have the personnel is beyond doubt. There will be more focus at Hampden on the discipline of the teams. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara poses with the Celtic boss and the League Cup at Hampden . So edgy and ill-tempered – and hugely enjoyable - was the Scottish Cup tie between these two teams at Tannadice last Sunday that people are already looking for ‘afters.’ Evidence of bad blood which might lead to another day of big decisions and navel-gazing over the state of Scottish refereeing. Warning his team to keep their discipline, Deila recalled: ‘It was the same against Rangers. If you lose your discipline there and get a red card you can lose the game. ‘I think we have been disciplined. Last Sunday some things happened after a situation. ‘Again, when something happens like that you must keep discipline and focus. So I expect my players to do that in every game now. ‘We have to be disciplined. We have to think and we have to not do stupid things. Stay on your feet and nothing will happen. ‘You have to have controlled aggression. John Collins is always saying that. We have to be determined and high on motivation and aggression. ‘We have to be clear thinkers about what to do in certain situations. We want the team to be like that and we want to be the same way.’ Chief Executive Peter Lawwell and Deila pictured after Celtic announce new agreement with New Balance . He locked his players away in a form of exile at their Lennoxtown training ground before the Rangers game and has employed similar tactics this week. Nothing has been left to chance. The Scottish League Cup gets a bad press. The crowds are poor, the interest levels low. The semi-finals were played on a Hampden pitch better suited to Chinese rice farmers, but a new surface has been laid for the final and Deila gave it the all-clear after a brief walkabout on Thursday. The prospect of a new Celtic manager going for his first trophy in charge sets a new narrative for Sunday. Nothing will be left to chance in pursuit of the prize. ‘All I do is go to Lennoxtown and then go home,’ said Deila. ‘You have to prepare for whatever is coming up, the next game all the time, and it has been a usual week for us. ‘We have big goals and one of them is to win trophies. The other is to develop the club in the direction I want it to go and they want it to go. ‘We have started well. The first year is always so hard wherever you go. You have to get people to understand what you believe in and you have to get to know people. If we can start by winning a trophy on Sunday, it would be a very good start.’", "answer": ["Celtic play Dundee United in the Scottish League Cup final on Sunday .\nRonny Deila's side are bidding to win the domestic treble this season .\nDeila says losing cup final in Norway was the worst thing he has done ."], "label": "SUM"}

Bottas sustained a very small tear in the annular part of a disc in his lower back during qualifying, leading to severe pain. Although the Finn made himself available to drive on Sunday morning ahead of the race, the FIA ultimately declared him unfit. Valtteri Bottas briefs the press about his injury at the Sepang Circuit Medical Centre on Thursday . Bottas declared himself fit for Melbourne after suffering a back injury in qualifying, but still missed the race . Ahead of Sunday's race in Malaysia, Bottas has now been given the all clear, albeit with the proviso from the FIA that 'in case of a recurrence of pain, or any abnormal feeling, he must stop at the earliest opportunity'. Bottas has no doubt he will come through unscathed as he said: 'The back is good, no pain, which is nice. 'At the end of last week I could do something without any pain, and during the weekend I could swim, cross-train without any pain, so the recovery was really good. 'We've done everything we can in this short period of time - luckily there are two weeks - so I feel confident of getting back in the car.' Bottas has revealed the injury was due to his brake and seat position inside his car, which have since been corrected. 'The back is now in a more neutral position, less pressure on the discs. We are confident that should be it,' added Bottas. Preparations are ramping up in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix . Mercedes director Toto Wolff (right) speaks with Bottas in the paddock in Kuala Lumpur . 'I've never had any problems before with the lower back.

'I did pass the tests, but the FIA had access to all the material from the hospital, from the MRI and that stuff. 'Maybe they thought it was better (not to race) in the longer term, which could have been true.

As a precaution, Williams on Thursday announced Adrian Sutil as their reserve driver, with the German back in Formula One after being axed by Sauber at the end of last year. Although Susie Wolff is test driver and young Briton Alex Lynn the development driver, Williams believe experience is crucial should a sudden change be required. Sir Frank Williams said: 'The fight for a top constructors' championship position will be intense this season.

{"question": "After a six-month hiatus from golf over alleged cocaine and alcohol abuse, Dustin Johnson appears to be back on form. On Sunday the 30-year-old claimed victory at the elite World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championships in Miami, telling reporters that fatherhood was behind his improved focus. Following his win, Johnson was greeted at the 18th hole on the Trump National Doral course by his model fiancée Paulina Gretzky - daughter of former NHL great Wayne - and their son Tatum, who was born in January. The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of cameras, while cradling their newborn between them.

Doting dad: He was overjoyed to see his model fiancée Paulina Gretzky - daughter of former NHL great Wayne - and their son Tatum, who was born in January . Perfect match: The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of cameras, while cradling their newborn between them . She continued to ABC News: 'He's been so supportive with me and we're just there for each other. I couldn't be happier for him.' Talking about how fatherhood had changed his life for the better, Johnson added: 'It's hard to describe, but just from the first day he's born, your perspective on life completely changes. 'Things that were important aren't important anymore. 'It kind of makes life a lot easier I think, just because there's just one thing that's kind of all you think about. It definitely simplifies stuff.' When Johnson announced his decision to step away from golf last July due to 'personal challenges', rumors about his lifestyle swirled, including the suggestion that he may have been suspended by the PGA Tour. Indeed, Golf.com reported that Johnson had failed three drug tests: one for marijuana in 2009 and two for cocaine, in 2012 and 2014. Johnson celebrates with Donald Trump as he holds the Gene Sarazen Cup after winning the WGC-Cadillac Championship WGC at Trump National in Doral . Career success: Johnson turned professional as a golfer in late 2007 in his early twenties . However, the Tour - which had initially said it did not comment on rumors or speculation - released a statement saying Johnson had taken a voluntary leave of absence and had not been suspended. And in a news conference on Sunday when if he had ever failed a Tour drugs test, Johnson replied: 'No. Thanks'. In a candid interview with Sports Illustrated this January, Johnson revealed that alcohol was his real vice. He said he would excessively drink and party to relieve stress, with his tipple of choice being Grey Goose, soda and lime. In a bid to get clean, Johnson said he took time out from sport and concentrated on home life. Bundle of joy: Johnson's son Tatum Gretzky Johnson was born on January 19 . Changed man: The golfer says fatherhood has helped him to put his bad boy party days behind him . Love birds: Johnson proposed to Gretzky in August 2013 - as of now, there are no reports of where and when a wedding will take place. Commenting on his time out, he said: 'I got to spend a lot of time with Paulina and help her as much as I could through her pregnancy, and then the birth of our son. 'I really enjoyed being able to be home and not having to leave or do anything. 'I was in the gym every single day, every morning, and then spend the rest of the time either I would go practice a little bit or just hanging out with Paulina.' Johnson returned to the green in Febuary at the Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines. As he won big on Sunday night, the two most important people in Johnson's life were waiting for him. He concluded: 'Paulina and Tatum were waiting for me when I got done. That was the best part of the day for sure.' 'My game is in good form. I feel really confident in my golf swing.

{"question": "Dressed in jumpsuits, hands in cuffs, or locked away in tiny cells, these are the youths held by America's juvenile justice system. The emotional portraits, taken at three 'school' facilities around Washington state, show the inmates standing in prison corridors and resting in their rooms - as well as others which simply try to show how they are feeling. All of the subjects have been locked away after sentencing in the state's juvenile courts, and are part of a project by photographer Steve Davis. Incarcerated: The photo series shows inmates held in Washington state's juvenile prison system, such as the two men above . Grim: One inmate is pictured above in his room, which features a combination toilet-sink, which seemingly leaks . Bleak surroundings: Photographer Steve Davis visited three school-cum-prison facilities in the state, and photographed inmates and their surroundings . Cuffed: These two prisoners have their wrists and ankles bound in the uncompromising portrait above . However, while Davis, whose images are due to be published in an upcoming book, focused on the prisoners' human side for his series, he deliberately left out one aspect: their pasts. Each portrait has been left without a label identifying the prisoner, in an attempt to break the link between those depicted and their crimes. He also shows their bleak living conditions, from a stark gym to a deserted exercise yard, to uncomfortable-looking standard-issue single beds. Marketing material for Davis's book says the intention is that 'the viewer must draw conclusions about each person’s past and possible future... from the simultaneously vast and limited information in each photograph'. Davis, who took the photographs between 1997 and 2005, met the subjects through his work as a resident artist in three of Washington's detention centers, which double as schools. Obscure: Davis made the deliberate decision not to mention the crimes which led to the youths being locked away . No home comforts: The images show bare sleeping, social and exercise space inside the prison system . Prison system: State officials say the juvenile detention centers are a last resort for dangerous youths or those who have no responded to other measures . Around 750 youths a year are sent to juvenile detention facilities in Washington. State information on the system says those sent there have often committed violent crimes or ignored previous punishments. Information from the overseeing Social and Health Services department says: 'These youngsters are typically serious and violent offenders or youth with extensive offense histories who have not responded to local sanctions and interventions.' Children as young as 12 can be incarcerated, and can stay in the facilities until they are 20. More than 90 per cent are male. According to data from September 2014, around two thirds are aged 16-18. Some 19 per cent are sex offenders, while 54 per cent have been convicted of violent crimes. Robbery, assault, burglary and rape feature prominently among the convictions which led to their incarcerations. Around half have mental health issues. Judgement?

{"question": "Mr Xie, a teacher in China, has been sacked after punishing two students by making them kneel on the floor and act as his footstool (above) A teacher in China has been sacked after punishing two students by making them kneel on the floor and act as footstools. Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs, People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally.

{"question": "France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent – and the death of French flair. France full back Scott Spedding (left), who was born in South Africa, makes a break against Italy in Rome . Racing Metro flanker Bernard le Roux (centre) is another South African-born player in France's ranks . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) was born in Fiji but now represents Les Bleus .

France coach Philippe Saint-Andre has come in for strong criticism following another mediocre campaign . VIDEO Italy v France - extended highlights . 72 per cent: English players in Premiership match day squads so far this season. 70 per cent: English players in 2014 Aviva Premiership final match day squads. 71 per cent: English players in Premiership sides for last round of Champions Cup. 45 per cent: French players in Top 14 squads, according to French study. 46 per cent: French players in 2014 Top 14 final match day squads. 62 per cent: French players in Top 14 sides for last round of Champions Cup. There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 . Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 . 'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.' Former France flanker Serge Betsen (right) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the Top 14 . Noa Nakaitaci . Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands. He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later. Rory Kockott . The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule. He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. Bernard Le Roux . Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam. He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro. Scott Spedding . Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game – guys like George Ford – who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle. Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good. Giant New Zealand-born prop Uini Atonio (right) is another foreign player that is part of the France squad . 'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in London where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one. He said the only shop around was at Twickenham, so he went to buy my tee for the game there, but nobody knew it! I will not tell you the name of the friend, but he is English!' France surely won't be short of a tee or two this time, but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the English capital. But Yachvili hasn't abandoned all hope. 'When people think we are no good, that is when France do something,' he said – ominously for the home side. 'On paper, we would say England will beat us easily, because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now. But with French rugby, we never know.'", "answer": ["England face France in the final round of the Six Nations on Saturday .\nFrance coach Philippe Saint-Andre has been heavily criticised following another disappointing Six Nations campaign .\nDimitri Yachvili concerned by high number of foreign players in Top 14 league .\nYachvili's goal-kicking secured France a 18-17 win at Twickenham in 2005 .\nIt was France's last victory at England HQ .\nSerge Betsen believes France are not developing enough young talent ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)Australia lodged a formal complaint Friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in Indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution. During the transfer, a senior Indonesian police officer was pictured in photos with the Australian pair on a flight. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were being taken from Kerobokan prison in Bali to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where they will be held in a maximum security facility before facing a 12-man firing squad. The date of the execution is not yet known, although the convicted will be informed at least 72 hours before they are put to death. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it had lodged a formal complaint with the Indonesian embassy in Canberra over the treatment of the prisoners during the transfer, which took place before dawn on Wednesday. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Australian media that an undue show of force, including armored vehicles and dozens of officers in helmets and balaclavas, was also used during the transfer. \"I just cannot comprehend it. They are two men who are described by their own prison governors as model citizens, two gentlemen who pose no risk to anyone,\" she told the ABC's AM program. \"I cannot comprehend the manner or the method of their transfer to the so-called execution island.\" A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the photos were taken without the consent of the officer involved,  Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo. \"The officer was inquiring about the physical condition of Mr Chan,\" Arrmanatha Nasir told CNN in regard to one of the images. \"It is regretful that this photo is being used by the media to portray something more than what it really is.\" Australia's complaint comes after Indonesia dismissed a last-minute proposal to save the pair's lives through a prisoner swap. Nasir told CNN that there are no Indonesian laws that would allow or provide for an exchange. \"Indonesia does not have legislation or laws or any other legal instruments that will enable the issue of a prisoner exchange to be conducted,\" he said, adding that the Australian government had been informed of this stance. Sukumaran and Chan, members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring, have been held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade. They are expected to be held in a maximum security facility on Nusakambangan where they will be isolated before being put to death. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution. Australian government and opposition parliamentarians attended a candlelight vigil at dawn Thursday, as a spectacular sunrise lit politicians from across Australia's political spectrum, united in opposition to the impending executions. \"We appeal to the Indonesian president to grant a stay of clemency,\" Bishop told the gathering. She reminded the Indonesian government that legal avenues remained open, before appealing for mercy on behalf of the convicted men's families. \"I've spoken to the families. They are going through an unimaginably difficult time and I ask that you think of the families who are praying that their son, brother, grandson can have their life spared. We appeal again to President Widodo, the leader of a strong and proud country, to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young Australians.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair. They have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. \"We abhor drug crime, but we abhor the death penalty. We think that these two Australians deserve to be punished, but they certainly don't deserve to be executed,\" he said. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, and Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator in the scheme. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. The attorneys wanted a review of the president's decision to deny them clemency. Todung Mulya Lubis, who represents the pair, said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons. \"There should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on,\" Lubis said. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Bishop has previously said. \"Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,\" she told the Australian Parliament in February. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. In December, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had \"severely affected\" relations with Indonesia.

{"question": "From treacherous road conditions to soggy jeans and frizzy hair - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain. But now there’s an ‘umbrella’ for bikes that’s designed to keep riders dry as they cycle along. The Leafxpro clip-on windshield, claims to enable cyclists to ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds. Scroll down for video . The Leafxpro clip-on windshield (the basic version is illustrated), is designed to that cyclists can ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds . Portuguese engineer and cycling enthusiast Manuel Brito, who came up with the idea, said the Leafxpro can withstand crosswinds of more than 50mph (80kph) because of its aerodynamic shape. ‘Leafxpro is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance and can be used in even the most demanding conditions,’ he said. The shield (pictured) is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance so it can be used in windy weather . ‘The resistance results showed that the kits can be used also in tougher conditions such as mountain biking as well.’ The plastic windshield will stop rain blowing into the face of a cyclist, and it shouldn’t steam up, like other more enclosed canopies. The device is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves, in just one minute. The kit weighs around 2.2lbs (1kg). It’s available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family. Prices range from £99 ($152) for the basic model to £199 (£305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat. Mr Brito, 40, said: ‘The idea of Leafxpro arose because we love cycling and it’s disappointing to have to use polluting means of transport just because of the bad weather. ‘We started thinking that there had to be an efficient, versatile and comfortable solution that would provide a sense of freedom for all people who love cycling.’ It has taken him years to design and test the product, which is a modular structure that adapts to different weather conditions. The canopy is  available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family (pictured) .Prices range from £99 ($152) for the basic model to £199 ($305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat . The device, which is designed to stop oncoming rain and keep a cyclist’s head and back dry, is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves. This image shows an illustration of the family version . ‘The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,’ he explained. ‘LeafXPro kits are designed for the urban cyclist, for anyone who commutes to work by bicycle, for parents wanting to cycle their kids to school or people who want to enjoy bike tours as a tourist during sightseeing.’ ‘The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,' Mr Brito said. The storm version covers a rider's head more as well as their arms . Last summer, a firm in Delft, the Netherlands, invented a simple clamp that fixes to a bike's handlebars to hold a windproof umbrella. The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too. The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph), because wind is directed over and around it. While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling. The clamp costs €39 (£31) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for €25 (£20) and €50 (£40).", "answer": ["Leafxpro clip-on windshield comes in four designs to keep cyclists dry .\nWas designed by a Portuguese engineer and cycling enthusiast .\nIt' claims to withstand crosswinds of more than 50mph (80kph)\nCollapsible windshield is available to pre-order from Kickstarter from £99 ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "A man from the NSW Hunter region who killed a litter of puppies by smashing them over the head with a rock has been slapped with an extra nine animal cruelty charges. It comes amidst news that the sole pup to survive the attack, nicknamed 'Lucky', is 'stable'. Earlier this month an advertisement was posted on website Gumtree selling a litter of bull terrier puppies. When the 11 pups failed to sell in a week, the seller offered them for free, police said at the time. Scroll down for video . The only pup to have survived the attack on a litter of bull terriers near New Castle last month -nicknamed 'Lucky' is doing well in RSPCA care . Police allege Nathan Thompson, 25, collected the animals on March 11 and took them to bushland at Kurri Kurri, near Newcastle. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock before throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove away from the area. An RSPCA inspector was called to the bushland and found five dead pups and another two still clinging to life. Nathan Thompson (pictured) pleaded guilty to nine extra animal cruelty charges in court on Thursday . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' The only pup to survive the ordeal has since been named 'Lucky' and is being cared for by the RSPCA, who last week confirmed she was doing well. 'There are rumours flying around about Lucky, the sole survivor of the horrible animal cruelty case in Kurri Kurri last week, that she isn't doing well. We are happy to quell these rumours and let you know that she is still stable and under close veterinary surveillance,' the RSPCA wrote on their Facebook page. He allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) 'Her condition has not deteriorated. If her condition does change, we will let the community know.' Thompson fronted court earlier this month and pleaded guilty to three animal cruelty charges and resisting arrest. On Thursday he pleaded guilty to another nine animal cruelty offences. He was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Thompson will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May. Thompson was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals. He will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May . According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail following his first charges, saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. He added that he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated.

{"question": "(CNN)The end of \"Jinx,\" the six-part HBO documentary about real estate heir Robert Durst, has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements Durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution. Durst, as you probably heard, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and he has been suspected, but never charged, in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. Whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the Constitution, as well as our fast-evolving ideas about privacy. While Durst's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial, the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in. Let's go over three main reasons why: . 1. Is this inadmissible hearsay? Probably not. Hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth. It really just means a witness can't testify at trial about someone else's version of the facts. If a sentence starts with \"He told me\" or \"She said that,\" it's probably hearsay.  As general proposition, hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible, but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception-riddled rule itself. Perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions. These can be admitted against a defendant. Why?  Well, the idea is that these statements are reliable. The thinking is that people don't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it. 2. Is this a violation of Durst's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination? Again, probably not. The rules of the U.S. Constitution are a different matter. The Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause states that \"[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ...\" By definition then, compulsory self-incrimination requires, well, \"compulsion.\"  And not just any compulsion. The kind of compulsion targeted by the Fifth Amendment is governmental coercion. Durst may still contend that his \"confession\" wasn't voluntary.  It's true that confessions deemed \"involuntary\" are often excluded at trial under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.  However, a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity. Voluntariness is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person, such as a journalist. What of Durst's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police?  Sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action, constitutionally speaking. This is not an easy case for a defendant to make, though.  Durst would have to establish that the HBO interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police. The police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians.  But the police frequently benefit from the work of good Samaritans or citizens volunteering information, photos or iPhone videos.  The television show \"America's Most Wanted\" has been premised on this idea for decades.  Given the defendant's burden here, it's unlikely that he can convince a judge that, in light of all the circumstances, filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police. The bottom line is this: A voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will, not physical intimidation or psychological pressure. How was Durst \"pressured\" when alone in the bathroom?  However, his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will. 3. Can Durst argue for some \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom? Not in our modern world, and not in this case. Perhaps in decades past, a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom, but things have changed. Subjects of documentaries and reality TV stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day.  Moreover, everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their \"hot\" mic.  In this brave new media world, the rule appears to be: You wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk. This is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews.  No matter how good an interviewee a client may be, audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites.  Admitting to killing \"them all\" would fall into this category. When it comes to giving interviews, it's probably better for defendants such as Durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt, especially doubt of the reasonable kind.", "answer": ["Robert Durst made some potentially incriminating statements at the end of HBO's \"Jinx\"\nDanny Cevallos: Durst's attorneys will want to bar their admission at trial, but they will likely be factored in ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A Florida man has captured astonishing video that shows an intelligent manatee drinking from a garden hose like a straw. The hose was hanging over the edge of a dock in Miami Beach when the 'sea cow' approached and 'grabbed' onto it with its flippers. It then shoves the end of the hose into its mouth to get its refreshing fill of fresh water, which it requires to survive. Even though manatees are found in salt water, they do not consume it. The large 'sea cow' swims over to the long blue hose in order to get its much-needed fresh water intake . Filmed from the end of the dock, the manatee can be seen in the water below holding onto a long blue hose with its flippers. It takes a drink from it as the video maker, Lawrence Schiffman, tells the people with him: ‘I like how he uses his arm to put it into his mouth.’ The video shows the marine mammal dropping the hose and swimming after it. Debating whether the manatee is a he or she, and deciding to go with the latter, Mr Schiffman continues to give a play-by-play of the animal’s actions. The video concludes with the obviously thirsty marine mammal still clutching onto the hose, guzzling water running from an unidentified source. The manatee can be seen using its flipper to grab the hose before it puts it into its mouth like a straw . Manatees are very large, fully aquatic and mostly herbivorous marine mammals. Studies suggest that they must have some access to fresh water for proper regulation of the salt within their bodies. This means that on average they must return to fresh water every one to two weeks to get their fill. Manatees ingest water through actively drinking as well as eating aquatic plants, and are able to move freely between marine environments.", "answer": ["The 'sea cow' uses its flippers to hold onto the long hose at Miami Beach .\nFootage shows manatee taking the hose into its mouth and guzzling water .\nManatees return to fresh water once every one to two weeks .\nEven though they are found in salt water they do not consume it ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "If you like the idea of having a conversation with your pet cat then you better look away now. Flam, a cat in Nashville, Tennessee, may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being. But sadly, as documented on video, the little chat didn't go down that well with the feline. In the clip is Penny Adams, a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the Cat Shoppe Rescue centre. Sitting on the floor, she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat-to-human language translator on her phone. Penny, who doesn't herself know what it is being translated by the app, activates the meowing sound and immediately Flam, who sits underneath a table, becomes noticeably intrigued. Penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat-to-human translator app on her phone . Jumping up, the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards Penny. With its tail poised, the cat maintains its eye-contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg. Suddenly it lashes out at her – opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw. Intrigued, the cat approaches Penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg . Reacting by blocking the cat with her arm, Penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off. According to Penny, she had visited Kate Framke's home – Flam’s owner – to photograph her other cat  Waffles for a fundraising calendar for The Cat Shoppe. After struggling to get Waffles’ attention with toys and treats, Penny used her human-to-cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera. The cat, clearly insulted by what the human-to-cat translator app is saying, attacks Penny with its paw . Penny said: ‘It worked, but it also got an unusual reaction from Flam, who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head. We laughed so hard.’ She added: ‘Who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice, but he sure didn't like it.’ The Cat Shoppe is Nashville’s first feline-friendly shop that sells a number of cat-related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre.

{"question": "David Cameron last night agreed to a single TV debate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister is expected to attend a seven-way session at the start of April, to be shown on ITV. The deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has agreed to one seven-way debate hosted by ITV on April 2. He will also appear on a number of election specials – but without going head to head against Ed Miliband . Crucially, the BBC, Sky, ITV and Channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head-to-head clash between the PM and Ed Miliband. And they have backed down from their apparent threat to ‘empty chair’ the PM by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend. Labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal, insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the PM of ‘running scared’ of a one-to-one with Mr Miliband. But, in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement, Mr Cameron said the other parties should accept it. ‘An offer’s been made, a deal’s been accepted, now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too, otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility,’ he said. ‘That’s what happened: a new offer put forward by the broadcasters, led by the BBC, to me, I accepted it, in full, on Saturday. So, I’m helping to make this debate go ahead. The other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg would only face Mr Cameron in one seven-way debate . The latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend. According to Tory sources, it includes four potential shows, the first in just nine days’ time on March 26. It will be a Channel 4 and Sky joint production hosted by Jeremy Paxman and featuring the PM and Mr Miliband, one after the other, facing questions from the host and a studio audience. The second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders, with the addition of Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. It will be broadcast by ITV on April 2. On April 16 the BBC is proposing a ‘challengers’ debate featuring the Greens, SNP, Ukip and Plaid. A week before polling day, on April 30, the BBC will host a 90-minute Question Time-style show with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a TV audience. This is a better deal for the Lib Dems, who complained that a head-to-head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government. A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should be fooled: David Cameron is still running scared of a head-to-head televised debate with Ed Miliband.’ n Mr Cameron poked fun at Ed Miliband for posing for TV cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his £2.5million London home. ‘I am not saying this to make a point but you shouldn’t pretend to be something you are not,’ the Prime Minister said. Showing off the open-plan kitchen he and wife Samantha had installed in Downing Street, he added: ‘We are lucky, we both work, we were able to spend our own money on this. ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.’ Under the broadcasters' latest proposal, the Tory, Lib Dem and Labour leaders would appear on Question Time hosted by David Dimbleby (left).

An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of rosé wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan. Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend. Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said \"that's my girl, what are you doing?\" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave. Mr Hughes, right, got annoyed while out with Ms Hoskins, left, when a man approached her for a dance . A witness who overheard the row saw Ms Hughes lie down in the road, pictured, and shout 'watch now, the next car that comes' as a Fire Engine approached, which managed to avoid her but  was hit by a hackney taxi . 'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed. 'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.' Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything. 'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out  if she was wearing high heels . Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally, Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.' Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting. 'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted \"watch now, the next car that comes\". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.' Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off. 'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.' The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision. Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring' Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.' The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement. Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him. Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen. 'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road. 'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor. The only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is Megan and sadly she is not here to tell me that.'", "answer": ["Megan Hoskins had taken cannabis, cocaine and alcohol before she died .\nShe and boyfriend Mark Hughes had a row immediately before the incident .\nMs Hoskins had been approached for a dance at a Working Men's club .\nMs Hoskins and Mr Hughes had a row while walking home after midnight .\nWitness said Ms Hoskins shouted  'watch now, the next car that comes'\nA Fire Engine narrowly missed Ms Hoskins while walking on the road .\nAfter she lay down she was hit by a hackney cab 'who stood no chance'\nShe was then hit by a second taxi and trapped beneath the vehicle .\nCoroner  Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the hearing ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "Jihadi John dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother, it was revealed today. Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as the killer in the infamous ISIS beheading videos last week - carried out the kidnap during his days living on a notorious housing estate. He and two bearded associates are said to have abducted two gang members accused of beating up his younger brother, Omar, in 2008. Mohammed Emwazi (left) - now unmasked as ISIS killer Jihadi John - reportedly kidnapped two schoolboys and threatened them with a gun after his younger brother Omar (right) was attacked  in 2008 . The brothers were living on the Mozart estate in west London at the time of the incident, which was known for its postcode gang 'the Mozart Bloods'. A former friend of Omar told the Evening Standard today that he went to buy a stolen bike from Emwazi's younger brother in 2008, a time when the now notorious terrorist was still studying at Westminster University. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said he and Omar were then attacked by two teenage members of the 'Bloods', who broke his arm because he was from a different postcode and punched Omar in the face. When Emwazi found out about the incident, he sought revenge on the two schoolboys who had carried out the beating, the source said. He told the London paper: 'They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. 'They dumped them on the M1 motorway. They weren't attacked physically but they were threatened. It was a message.' A former friend of Omar Emwazi say boys who assaulted him and Omar were dumped on the M1 motorway without their clothes in revenge for the violent attack (file picture) Details of Emwazi's links to criminals have emerged since he was unmasked as the ISIS killer last week . The source said Emwazi was not a known gang member at the time but was 'a bit of a hard nut'. Since Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John last week,  his links to criminals during his time growing up in London have been exposed. He was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi – a member of a gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks and who also later travelled to Syria to join ISIS. The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below Emwazi at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood, North West London, which Omar also attended. It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and was twiceacquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi, who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Emwazi's former home (pictured) was on the Mozart estate in west London known for its postcode gang . Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted. Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods - bikes - at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Emwazi family in England are now in hiding while father in living in his native Kuwait, from where he has questioned whether his son Mohammed is the killer in the Jihadi John films. It was reported today that Emwazi - who was known to the security services after being accused of trying to get into Somalia - slipped out of Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry before crossing Europe to get to Syria. The BBC has defended its coverage of the unmasking of Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi after viewers accused them of glamorising his cause. Emwazi was named last week and details about his family life and education in west London were uncovered by journalists. On the day his identity emerged, the BBC broadcast live from a press conference by prisoner's rights group Cage for 52 minutes. At the press conference, the group's leader Asim Qureshi called the masked killer 'a beautiful young man' and blamed security services for his actions. A BBC journalist gives a live update from outside the home of Mohammed Emwazi last week. The corporation has defended itself against claims it 'glamorised' the ISIS killer . The BBC said it had received 'some complaints from viewers and listeners who feel there has been too much coverage' of the story. But a corporation spokesman said the story was 'globally significant' and the identification of Emwazi was 'an important development'. He said: 'We have a responsibility to report the story as well as examine Emwazi's background and shed light on his radicalisation. We don't believe that our coverage has glamorised him or Islamic State. 'We have made it very clear that he appears to be responsible for a number of brutal killings, and is a member of a growing, well-armed, well-financed organisation that commits acts of brutality and is having a profound impact on the security of the Middle East. 'We feel BBC News has reported on the activities of Islamic State and Mohammed Emwazi in a clear and accurate manner.'

{"question": "Death Row: Kelly Gissendaner (pictured) is set to die by lethal injection in Georgia at 7pm tonight . The only woman in Georgia on death row is due to be executed tonight at 7pm - after an astonishing last meal of cheeseburgers, fries, ice cream and a fatty salad - unless lawyers can convince officials to spare her life. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, is due to be given a lethal injection at a state prison in Jackson in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997. She was sentenced to die after her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death at her urging. Gissendaner, who will be the first female executed in Georgia in 70 years, has also made headlines with her request from prison authorities for a no-holds-barred last meal. The feast includes two Burger King Whoppers, two large orders of fries, cornbread, a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream. However, there is a chance she receive a last-minute stay of execution - if her lawyers convince Georgia's justice system to cancel the killing. Attorneys are mounting a last-ditch attempt to persuade the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her sentence to life without parole. She was denied clemency at a hearing last week, but lawyers argue that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade them. Previous attempts have rested on her remorse and new-found faith. In a statement ten years ago, Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die'. Murder: Gissendaner, shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997, is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen, right, who actually did the deed, is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade . Monster meal: Gissendaner, pictured above with a regular prison meal, requested an enormous spread including two cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, and popcorn for her last meal . She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023. If the bid fails, her lawyers are expected to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. It has already denied one appeal. Her execution had been due to take place last week, but was canceled after a winter storm caused disruption in the area. Gissendaner would be the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. Gissendaner's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency. But, her lawyers argue, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.' The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison. Locked away: Gissendaner, pictured above in 2004, has been locked up for the past 17 years . Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote. Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation. Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on Gissendaner's behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year. 'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on Jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years. 'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote. Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial. The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote. 'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote. Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters want her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote. In statements submitted with her clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother. 'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family.", "answer": ["Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, to receive lethal injection in Jackson at 7pm .\nShe plotted the 1997 murder of her husband with her boyfriend .\nChose cheeseburgers, fries, cornbread, ice cream, buttermilk-dressed salad, lemonade and popcorn for last meal .\nGissendaner's lawyers are begging Georgia authorities for stop her death .\nHave claimed that she has found God in prison and is reformed .\nGeorgia has not executed a woman since 1946 ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "A Lingerie Bowl player and personal assistant was forced to go topless in front of her boss's friends and babysit his prostitutes when he passed out, she claims in a lawsuit. Lotti Bluemner, 31, accuses investor Erik Gordon, 41, of coercing her into exposing her bare breasts in front of crowds so he could snort cocaine off them to impress women. His requests did not stop even after she got pregnant, according to court documents seen by the New York Post. Suing Gordon, head of Ergo Media Capital LLC, for unfair dismissal, Bluemner is demanding $13 million in damages. Battle: Lotti Bluemner (right) claims she felt compelled to expose her breasts for Erik Gordon (left) and his A-list friends at drug-fueled parties in order to keep her $90,000-a-year job as his personal assistant in LA . Past career: Bluemner was a kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 Lingerie Bowl tournament, coming second . Bluemner, from Brookfield, Wisconsin, featured in Lingerie Bowl, which involved women playing full-contact football in their underwear, pads and helmets. A kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 tournament, she helped secure victory against Dallas Desire in the semi-finals but ultimately lost to New York Euphoria. Her $90,000-a-year job was meant to be an administrative role at Gordon's home in LA, organizing his diary, the Post reported. However, in court documents seen by DailyMail.com, she claims she was used to 'essentially babysit' as Gordon went 'partying, drinking, and consuming various illegal drugs each night... as well as regularly engaging strippers and prostitutes.' Gordon rejects Bluemner's claims and says that she stole $1,200 from his credit card at the Apple store . 'Used': Bluemner's lawsuit claims she was used to help Gordon pick up women . She adds that 'Gordon's modus operandi, consisted of trading upon his father's (one of the founders of Angelo & Gordon) wealth, fame, connections, and political capital by taking meetings during the day with his and his father's wealthy and politically connected friends, celebrities, and politicians' before partying. And she was ordered, she says, to take his new girlfriend on multi-thousand dollar shopping sprees. In papers seen by DailyMail.com, Gordon rejects the accusations and claims Bluemner used his credit card to spend $1,229.51 on personal items from the Apple store. Bluemner denies theft. Now based in Florida, with business in New York, Gordon has filed his counter claim in Manhattan, while Bluemner's case will be heard in California's Federal Court. Gordon told the Post: 'Everyone who knows me and knows Ms. Bluemner has found humor in her bizarre allegations . . .

{"question": "The bereaved parents of a Minnesota teen with a severe dairy allergy who died from eating pancakes are suing the small town diner where he was served them. Cindy Johnson, mother of 16-year-old Scott Johnson, says she asked staff at the Minnesota Nice Cafe in Bemidji if their gluten-free pancakes were also dairy-free during a rare dining-out last June for the teen, who'd suffered from the deadly allergy since birth. Johnson was assured the pancakes were safe and watched as her son ate two of them, reads the complaint. Three days later, Scott would be dead. Assured they were okay: The bereaved parents of a teen with a severe dairy allergy who died last year after eating dairy-laced pancakes are suing the diner that served them to him . Severely allergic: 16-year-old Scott Johnson of Bemidji had been to the hospital due to dairy exposure before. His family had learned to be very careful about what and where he ate . 'He had just finished and he said ''we have to go now,\"' Cindy Johnson recalled of the moments after Scott, her second of four children, ingested the fatal breakfast. Scott had suffered allergic reactions before, even from the slightest exposure to dairy. Previous trips to the emergency room had taught his family to be extremely cautious. 'If it wasn’t right, we didn’t eat until his was right,' Scott's father Steve Johnson told WCCO. However, the Johnsons say they were assured by staff at Minnesota Nice that everything would be fine. And it just so happened that Scott had forgotten to bring along his life-saving EpiPen and nebulizer that June day. Cindy rushed her son home. But when they got there, the epinephrine and nebulizer failed to calm Scott's short-circuiting immune system. 'I was eighteen miles off the highway when I got the call,' said Steve Johnson, who was two hours away on a construction job when he learned his son was in dire straits. 'Hardest thing for me was I didn’t even get to talk to him.' Special breakfast: The family didn't normally go out to eat, but Scott's sisters wanted to treat him and their mother one morning last June . Communication failure? According to the complaint, the Minnesota Nice Cafe staff assured Cindy that her son's pancakes contained no dairy. Cindy also maintains she told them the grill would have to be cleaned before Scott's pancakes were cooked on it . Doctors told the Johnsons the dairy exposure had led to anaphylaxis so severe that Scott's heart had stopped. Three days after the family breakfast, Scott died. Now the grieving mother and father are facing massive medical bills and want the Minnesota Nice Diner to take responsibility. 'Just one mistake can take someone’s life,' Cindy Johnson said. The Minnesota Nice Cafe owners are not commenting publicly on the pending case. As the case moves forward, a benefit has been organized for July at which a raffle and auction will be held to benefit the Johnsons financially. Friends of the family have also set up a GoFundMe page, where donations can be made to help the family offset the cost of medical bills. Tragic: Scott had forgotten his lifesaving EpiPen and nebulizer that day in June when his immune system went haywire at the Minnesota Nice Cafe . Cindy rushed her son home, but when they arrived his EpiPen and nebulizer didn't seem to work .

{"question": "Labour and David Cameron's Tories remain neck and neck, despite the Conservatives being ahead in the polls . Tomorrow the Queen dissolves Parliament and the Election campaign begins. It will be the strangest Election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled. Most expected that, with economic recovery, and Cameron ahead of Miliband in the polls as favoured Prime Minister, the Tories would pull ahead. That has not happened. Labour and the Tories remain neck and neck. Only a fool, or a social scientist, would predict the outcome. The two major parties now attract a diminishing share of voters – about two in three in 2010 compared with more than 96 per cent in 1951. Voters have a wider choice than ever before. In England, they can opt for three other alternatives – not just the Lib Dems, but also Ukip and the Greens – all of whom score more than five per cent in the polls. In Scotland and Wales, there is a further alternative – the Nationalists. The weakening of the two party system makes a hung Parliament very likely. But, curiously, a small overall majority for the Tories or Labour could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament. The Tories would be at the mercy of their Eurosceptic Right wing, as John Major was in 1992. He had a majority of just 21, and used to say that he was at the mercy of 13 of them who were quite mad. They made his life a misery when he sought to ratify the Maastricht Treaty reforming the European Union. A Labour government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its Left wing which opposes austerity. Labour, contrary to Tory propaganda, is committed not to a splurge in public spending, but to public expenditure cuts, though less severe than Cameron and Osborne are proposing. But Labour austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters, many of whom look for rapid improvements in the NHS and social care. Speaking two weeks ago at the London School of Economics, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, advised English voters to support the Greens or what she called ‘progressive’ Labour candidates, that is candidates opposed to austerity. She hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next Parliament, composed of the SNP, Greens and Left-wing Labour. That would cause problems for Miliband even if he won a majority. But, obviously, a hung parliament is more likely. The key question is whether it will lead to stable government, as it did in 2010. Many then thought, including myself, that the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition could not last. But it has, and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the Commons it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in Parliament. The danger in 2015 is that no majority coalition can be formed. Under our electoral system, Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats. That is why both support proportional representation. The SNP, which may well win many seats, will not deal with the Tories and will not join Labour in a coalition. If, as is likely, the Lib Dems lose seats then, even if they were prepared to enter another coalition, that might not be able to secure the 325 seats needed for a majority. This would mean that no two parties – other than the Tories and Labour – could command a majority. We would have a fragmented hung parliament. There would have to be a minority government. The last minority government following a General Election occurred in February 1974 after Ted Heath had gone to the country in the middle of a miners’ strike asking the voters to decide ‘Who Governs?’ The voters, however, refused to give a clear answer and, in the fragmented hung parliament that followed, Labour governed as a minority for seven months. There was then a second General Election in October at which Labour won a small majority. Minority governments do not last long and, being dependent on bargaining with other parties, find it difficult to take long-term decisions. The longest-lasting was between 1929 and 1931, but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between Labour and the Liberals. Under our electoral system, Nigel Farage's Ukip and the Greens are unlikely to win many seats . In the past, the Prime Minister could try, as Labour did in 1974, to escape from the minority situation by dissolving Parliament. But the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, providing for five-year parliaments, makes that option more difficult. Besides, there is no reason to believe a second General Election would, as in 1974, deliver a majority government. It could easily reproduce the same result. Why have we entered this messy period of multi-party politics, and will it prove more than a temporary condition? I believe it will, because it stems from a new social cleavage in British politics, a cleavage between those who have benefited from globalisation, from social and economic change, and those who have been left behind. The two major parties, together with the Lib Dems, represent the beneficiaries. Their leaders all believe Britain should stay in the EU. They all broadly welcome immigration. They all favour gay marriage. But many voters do not favour these things, and feel unrepresented by the mainstream parties. Alex Salmond (pictured) and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England . The typical Ukip supporter is not, as we used to think, Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, a retired Army officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole, but a working-class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system. Blair’s New Labour sought to win over graduates and middle-class professionals – those who aspired to leave the working class. Cameron’s Conservatives sought to distance themselves from the image of the ‘nasty party’ by rejecting Thatcherism and embracing modernisation; while Cameron and Osborne, liberal-minded men, seem remote in lifestyle and understanding from those left behind. Ukip, in consequence, is now the most working-class party in English politics. The SNP in Scotland is different from Ukip in many respects. But it, too, represents the left behind. The vote in the independence referendum last September was a class vote. Labour areas in the west central belt around Glasgow voted ‘Yes’ to independence, while middle-class SNP areas in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire voted ‘No’. West Dunbartonshire, with nearly the lowest life expectancy in Scotland, voted ‘Yes’, East Dunbartonshire, with nearly the highest, voted ‘No’. Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon are doing to Labour in Scotland what Nigel Farage is doing to the Tories in England. The SNP could well be the third-largest party in the next Parliament, even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the Lib Dems, Ukip and the Greens. That will strain the Union to breaking point. In England, Cameron says if you vote for Farage you will get Miliband. In Scotland, Miliband says if you vote SNP, you will get Cameron. But, to the left behind, Cameron and Miliband are equivalent – members of an Oxbridge liberal elite who represent the exam-passing classes who do not understand the aspirations of the less fortunate. That is why the multi-party system is here to stay and why we are about to enter an era of political instability.

{"question": "It's the run of games which will go a long way to deciding whether Manchester United are playing Champions League or Europa League football next season. Four of the Premier League's top six - Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea - in their next fives games. Make-or-break for Louis van Gaal and his players. Other than the home clash with relegation-threatened Aston Villa on April 4, Sunday's visit of Spurs would appear to be United's best hope of three points over the next month and a half. But recent results tell a different story. Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected during defeat by Arsenal . Christian Eriksen scores Tottenham's winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford last season . Eriksen is mobbed by his team-mates after helping Tottenham to their second consecutive win at Old Trafford . 29.09.2012 - Manchester United 2-3 Tottenham . 20.01.2013 - Tottenham 1-1 Manchester United . 01.12.2013 - Tottenham 2-2 Manchester United . 01.01.2014 - Manchester United 1-2 Tottenham . 28.12.2014 - Tottenham 0-0 Manchester United . Having won 17 and drawn five of their previous 22 games against Tottenham, United now find themselves without a win in their last five matches with the north London outfit. Mauricio Pochettino's men battled to a 0-0 at White Hart Lane in December but Spurs have won their previous two visits to Old Trafford, ending a 23-year wait for victory with a 3-2 triumph in September 2012. United had gone 26 games without defeat at home to Spurs in all competitions - winning their previous nine - before a Jonny Evans own goal and strikes from Gareth Bale and Clint Dempsey gave Andre Villas-Boas' men a memorable win in Manchester. And Tottenham proved that result was no fluke last season when goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen sealed a 2-1 victory for Tim Sherwood's side. Gareth Bale scores during Tottenham's 3-2 victory at Old Trafford in September 2012 - their first in 23 years . Clint Dempsey celebrates after netting Spurs' winner against Sir Alex Ferguson's side . Then Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas shows his delight after the final whistle . Two draws at White Hart Lane - 1-1 in January 2013 and 2-2 in December 2013 - were sandwiched between those victories, taking Spurs' unbeaten run to an impressive five games. So impressive, in fact, that they are only the third team to manage such a run against United. Liverpool did the same between 2000 and 2002, winning four consecutive games against their great rivals - including two at Old Trafford - and drawing once. Blackburn Rovers also went five games unbeaten against the Red Devils between 2004 and 2006, winning at Old Trafford in September 2005 and coming out on top in two fixtures at Ewood Park. Just three points behind United going into Sunday's game, Tottenham have a major incentive to pull off their third successive win at Old Trafford and become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era.

Spurs striker Harry Kane (left) battles for the ball with Jonny Evans in this season's clash at White Hart Lane . Football data analysts BSports believe a Manchester United home win is easily the most likely outcome . Victory would mean Pochettino's side would be out of the Champions League places by goal difference only, something they will be confident of improving upon in upcoming games against Leicester, Burnley, Aston Villa and Newcastle. And in  Harry Kane, the Premier League's hottest striker and Premier League Player of the Month for February, Spurs have a man capable of causing United's frail defence all sorts of problems.

{"question": "A family are furious after staff refused to allow their soya and dairy intolerant toddler to eat his special packed lunch in the restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food.

{"question": "England's Ross Fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a European Tour title for the first time in his career in this week's Tshwane Open. Fisher ended a four-year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at The Els Club at Copperleaf, which, at 7,964 yards, was the longest course in European Tour history. This year the tournament, which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour this season, has been switched to Pretoria Country Club, which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par-five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours, making it a par 70. Ross Fisher says it will be tough for him at the Tshwane Open this year but that he is looking forward to it . The Englishman plays a shot during a practice round at the Pretoria Country Club . Fisher poses with the trophy last year . 'It's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly,' said Fisher of the course, which was redesigned in 2004 by Gary Player, who calls it a 'hidden gem'. 'There will be a lot of positional play off the tee, a lot of irons and not many drivers. 'It's an adaptation that we have to make as players. We don't generally play these types of golf courses. 'It's very different and I would prefer to be on a long golf course that's quite tight, because driving is my strength. 'It's going to be different this week. Your wedges will have to be sharp and you're going to have to get a hot putter, because I can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week. 'I'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that.' Compatriot Andy Sullivan missed the cut in the Africa Open last week but is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks, while home favourite George Coetzee has the benefit of local knowledge. Pretoria native Coetzee has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10. 'I didn't build my game at this golf course,' Coetzee said. 'I putted well to shoot good scores here, but it's a drawer's golf course. There is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on.

{"question": "Phil Jagielka has warned Everton team-mate Ross Barkley that he will have to wait patiently for a place in England’s midfield. Barkley was still only 19 years old when he made his England debut in September 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for Everton last season which earned him a place at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil. But this campaign the 21-year-old has struggled for the same kind of form and, despite winning 10 England caps already, does not currently appear to be in Roy Hodgson’s first-team plans. Barkley has been played in multiple positions for club and country and Everton manager Roberto Martinez has experimented the most with him out on the wing, as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle. Ross Barkley may have to wait for his chance to impress with England, according to team-mate Phil Jagielka . Jagielka spoke on Wednesday about his club team-mate's progress in what has been a difficult season . The Everton skipper said he believed Barkley would have to bide his time and wait for an opportunity . ‘I think Ross will have to bide his time,’ Jagielka, who is his club captain, said. ‘And when he does get the opportunities for England, keep playing the way he has, keep playing well, keep being positive and hopefully when he gets that chance to play in two or three games on the spin, that is his chance keep the shirt and make it much harder for someone to take it off him. ‘It is difficult with the position he would try to get in the team in. We have got a fantastic amount of midfielders that come away with England and quite a lot who want to play in a similar position.’ One player almost certain of a starting place in the crunch games is goalkeeper Joe Hart. After being dropped by Manchester City earlier in the season, he has worked his way back into guaranteed first pick. Barkley has had a difficult season with Everton after a brilliant breakthrough campaign last year . That season resulted in a World Cup call-up, and Barkley looked a bright spark against Costa Rica . Earlier in England's group, Barkley congratulates Wayne Rooney after coming on against Uruguay . That culminated in his stand-out performance against Barcelona, in which Lionel Messi described him as ‘phenomenal’ even though he could not prevent City going out of the Champions League. Jagielka, Barkley and the rest of their Everton team-mates watched the match in Kiev ahead of their Europa League tie. ‘We were pretty much laughing at the performance from Joe,’ Jagielka revealed. ‘It was just one of those nights. ’It is sometimes difficult to get the accolades when you're at a big team. It is normally the people scoring the goals and things like that, but when Joe is needed he normally comes up trumps with some fantastic saves or some fantastic decisions in games.'

{"question": "(CNN)The news was stunning to hear: A young woman, 18-year-old Michelle Carter, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide. How could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased, Conrad Roy, 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing? And what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text? But a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe, life-altering legal consequences. That is why Lisa Green, author of the informative new book \"On Your Case: A Compassionate (and Only Slightly Bossy) Legal Guide for Every Stage of a Woman's Life,\" believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case. \"To me this is the unrecognized area that parents, particularly parents of teens, miss all the time,\" said Green during a recent interview at CNN's studios. \"So many of our friends have armies of tutors, extracurricular activities, all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law, there's this black hole.\" Mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . Green, a journalist, lawyer and television legal analyst, says people often think of  the law as scary and intimidating and believe they don't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble. Whether it's a case as serious as Carter's involuntary manslaughter charge, or a simple allegation of vandalism, parents need to be prepared, Green said. \"I cannot count the number of kids I know, good kids, who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" said Green. \"I have now two young adults, and when they were going through their teenage years, it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong, a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions, bringing something to school they shouldn't have. \"And in each of those cases, a little bit of knowledge of the law, a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are, the right way to behave, would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief.\" Green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone, or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the SAT. Parents' house seized after son's drug bust . \"I am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what's available to you to help you parent better,\" she said. She gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age. For instance, what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts? What parents should know, Green said, is that a school can't open a cell phone for no reason at all. \"They need to have reasonable suspicion that something's wrong,\" said Green, who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials. \"If you're asked, as a child, for a locker search, to open a phone, to open a laptop, if it's your property, pause and ask if you could call Mom and Dad,\" she said. \"We can act whether we're lawyers or not as that first line of defense.\" Green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school's code of conduct. \"They don't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say, 'Who can I party with?' But it's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance\" for activities such as drinking on campus, she said. And even before teens head off to college, parents should know about social host laws, where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic. Scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . More than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. In some cases, parents can be held liable even if they didn't know the drinking was taking place. \"It doesn't have to be you with the shaker, like an episode of 'Mad Men,' serving up Manhattans to a group of grateful teens,\" said Green. \"If you've made it possible in your home, if you don't lock your liquor cabinet -- I never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking, that could be a problem as well.\" While Green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law, she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home. \"I am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility. If a kid does something wrong, if they broke the law, they ought to be punished appropriately by it. But we also live in a society where we have legal rights, and I want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment.\" So if after reading this, you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer, how on earth do you go about finding one? Green's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association, since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues. Then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers, asking them everything from how much their services would cost (that can vary), to who would handle the work, to what their philosophy is about the law and teens' rights. \"You may or may not end up being friends afterwards, but that's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you.\" Do you think it's important for parents of teens to be aware of the law and their children's legal rights?

{"question": "A video has emerged believed to show ISIS executioner Jihadi John ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in Syria from the UK. The footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist Omar al-Shishani. At the front stands a man thought to be Mohammed Emwazi - the west Londoner last week unmasked as the killer of Western hostages in a series of videos which have shocked the world. A man thought to be Jihadi John proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013. The video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi . The video is thought to have been filmed  just months after Emwazi is understood to have fled Britain to take up arms alongside the extremists. It shows a pledge of allegiance made when the so-called 'Army of Muhammad Brigades' group joined forces with the so-called 'Brigade of Migrants', of which Emwazi is believed to have been a member. The speaker proclaims: 'This army announces unity within its ranks for the sake of implementing the Shariah and returning this blessed land to God the most glorified and the most high under the leadership of the emir Umar al-Shishani.' Emwazi, now 26, attempted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia after finishing his university course in London in 2009, but was refused entry to Tanzania and  returned to Britain, from where he later went to Syria. He is thought to have been in a group who were among the first to go to fight in the Middle East, along with fellow Londoners Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, Choukri Ellekhlifi and Mohammad el-Araj. Ellekhlifi was two years above Emwazi in his north London school, Quinton Kynaston Academy, and later became part of a robbery gang which carried out a series of raids in central London. Ellekhlifi, 22, fled to Syria while on bail and was killed fighting near Aleppo in August 2013, months after the video thought to feature Emwazi was filmed. El-Araj, 23, was killed two weeks later during a firefight. Al-Mazwagi, from North London was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. Emwazi was last week unmasked as the killer who carried as series of beheadings of Western hostages . In the film, the man thought to be Emwazi stands in front of notorious terror leader Omar al-Shishani (right) Emwazi's links to the London crime gang meant he had developed a love of violence, which led to him being chosen to feature in the beheading videos for which is now known throughout the world. In the latest video, the man suspected of being Emwazi stands at the front of a long line of gun-toting militants, with al-Shishani standing behind him arm-in-arm with two other fighters. Commenting on the likenesses of Emwazi to the speaking in the latest video to emerge, Raffaello Pantucci of the Royal United Service Institute told MailOnline: 'Given he’s masked, it is difficult to make the precise connection between the two, though there are definite similarities. 'Given the group and community that Emwazi came from – the West London group - were all alongside the Katiba al Muhajireen under Omar al Shishani, it might well fit that it could be Emwazi. 'Given his solid Arabic and his willingness to be front and centre in films, it would fit that it could be him. Al Shishani seems to have been quite willing to record films of himself with his foreign fighter warriors.' Charles Winter from the Quilliam Foundation added: 'There are certainly similarities between Emwazi and the man speaking in this video, the eyebrows for example. 'In terms of the group, we know that it has a large proportion of foreign fighters so there's a possibility that he could have joined but I'm unable to say whether it is definitely him. The video shows a pledge of allegiance to Omar al-Shishani, now a commander of ISIS in Syria . Emwazi is thought to a fighter (second right beneath flag) who appears in another photo featuring al-Shishani . Mr Winter added: 'While he does have certain features that resemble Emwazi, there have been numerous false alarms with ID-ing \"Jihadi John\" in the past. A balaclava does a lot to obscure one's face, and a lot to make people look similar, too.' Others have cast doubt on whether the man is Emwazi, saying the speaker in the film looks shorter than the Londoner and appears to be holding the Kalashnikov rifle with his right hand, whereas Jihadi John held his knife in his left hand. If the video does show Emwazi, the footage would be the first known time he appeared on camera in Syria after going to fight. It is believed he was one of more than 700 fighters in The Migrants Brigade who arrived in the Middle East three years ago. The group were not part of ISIS at the time the video was filmed, but joined the group in the months that followed. Emwazi has since become one the world's most wanted men after he appeared in a series of gruesome videos beheading a series of foreign hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Mohammed Emwazi is believed to have among a group of Brits, which also includes Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (left), Choukri Ellekhlifi (centre) and Mohammad el-Araj (right), who were among the first to travel to Syria to fight . Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (centre), the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, is pictured here with Abu Omar al-Shishani (right), one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani has  moved from the conflicts of the Caucasus, south of Russia to become one of the most feared commanders in the ISIS army now terrorising Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani, whose real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from the Caucasus nation of Georgia, specifically from the Pankisi Valley, a centre of Georgia's Chechen community and once a stronghold for militants. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused re-enlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012 to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. The red-bearded fanatic became the commander of the Brigade of Migrants, which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form the Army of Emigrants and Supporters, a larger and more structured group with a religious council. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and has become the group's military commander in Syria, leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the Iraq border.

{"question": "The family of an 11-year-old boy are suing the Publix grocery chain, saying the child was allergic to nuts and died from a severe reaction after eating a cookie despite a worker's assurance it was safe. The lawsuit says Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville. The boy, who was visiting family in Tennessee, was allergic to tree nuts. Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville and now his family are suing the food chain . The lawsuit, which was filed on March 20, says the store bakery did not post warnings about ingredients or possible cross-contamination, and the mother bought the cookie only after a worker assured her it was safe. Derek's family filed the lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Nashville and are seeking unspecified amount of damages. They claim the grocery store should be declared liable under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act 'to raise awareness of potential fatal food allergies in American children.' The family also claims Publix was negligent for not labeling its baked goods and identifying any allergens, for not posting signs warning of potential allergens or cross-contamination and for not properly training employees to respond to questions about food allergens. A Publix spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation but said in an email that the company posts allergen information at its bakeries. 'We were very sorry about the loss if this young man. Our prayers go out for him and his family,' a Publix Super Markets spokesperson told USA Today. The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix Super Market in Clarksville, above . The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix store. Landon's mom bought an unlabeled 'Chocolate Chew' cookie that he wanted. The mother specifically asked a Publix employee at the bakery counter whether the cookie contained any tree nuts.

It was Real's first Champions League defeat at home in 22 games since Barcelona beat them 2-0 in April 2011 and was only the second time they had conceded four goals in a European game at the Bernabeu. However, a Cristiano Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema strike were enough to secure a place for Real in the draw for the last eight on March 20. The Dutch striker's brace was not enough to see the Bundeliga outfit though after a 2-0 defeat in the first leg . 'I was hoping we could go into the break 2-1 up but we unfortunately didn't manage it. That would of course have made the game more interesting for us,' added Di Matteo.

Not since the 1986 World Cup have the Northern Irish graced a big stage. Indeed, they have never qualified for the finals of the European Championships. But after Kyle Lafferty scored twice against Finland at Windsor Park to take his total in qualifying to five goals in five games, Michael O’Neill’s side will never have a better chance as they remain one point behind leaders Romania following their fourth win of the campaign. Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty celebrates after scoring against Group F rivals Finland at Windsor Park .

Star man: Kyle Lafferty . Northern Ireland remain just one point behind Group F leaders Romania . The two countries meet here in June when Northern Ireland will have a great opportunity to go top. Even if it all goes wrong, this result puts them eight points clear of fourth-placed Finland and almost guaranteed of at least a playoff place. ‘We’re in a really strong position, there’s no doubt about that,’ said O’Neill. ‘Will 18 points be enough? Possibly. But Belfast in June is as far as we’re looking ahead.’ Finland simply couldn’t handle Lafferty, the 6ft 4in striker on loan to Turkish club Caykur Rizespor from Norwich after a frustrating spell at Carrow Road, who made life as difficult for them as possible in the blustery conditions. He had already caused central defenders Joona Toivio and Niklas Moisander plenty of problems before putting Northern Ireland in command with two classy finishes in the space of six minutes. The first goal came from a freekick after Lafferty was fouled by an exasperated Moisander in the 33rd minute. Finland cleared Oliver Norwood’s inswinging free-kick but Niall McGinn nodded the ball back to Lafferty 15 yards from goal and he showed fantastic technique to turn and volley it beyond goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky and into the far corner. Ireland looked most dangerous down their right-hand side and when Jamie Ward and Conor McLaughlin combined once again in the 38th minute, Lafferty met Conor McLaughlin’s pin-point cross with a glancing header into the bottom corner. Lafferty celebrates with his Northern Ireland team-mates during his side's 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier against Finland . Premier League stars such as Jonny Evans (centre left on back row) and Chris Brunt (centre right on back row) started for Northern Ireland . It was no surprise to see Toivio hooked at half-time in favour of the more muscular Paulus Arajuuri – ‘a tactical substitution,’ was the curt response from Finland boss Mixu Paatelainen afterwards – or Lafferty receive a standing ovation when he was replaced by Josh Magennis 11 minutes from time. He is now second only to David Healy in the list of Ireland’s all-time leading goalscorers. ‘Kyle was outstanding again and he scored two fantastic goals,’ added O’Neill. ‘He’s going on the pitch believing he’s capable of scoring every time he plays. ‘It’s a little bit like the David Healy situation where things at club level aren’t going as well as he would like. But he’s showing what he’s capable of against top-class European defenders.’ Finland substitute Berat Sadik pulled a goal back in the first of three minutes of added time to set up an unnecessarily nervy finish, but Ireland held on and the celebrations told their own story.

{"question": "Ella Draper (pictured) and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture . An evil mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Ella Draper and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in Hampstead, North London, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. She named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’. The judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters, aged eight and nine, cannabis soup to gain their compliance. More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the ‘main action’ was alleged to have happened, the ruling said. The ‘grotesque’ claims against ‘blameless’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. Cult members were said to have drunk their victims’ blood and danced around with the babies’ skulls. At least seven other schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘rituals’ were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald’s fast food restaurant. The children’s father Ricky Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2006, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: ‘Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. ‘Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example – “We’re coming for you. You paedo scum”.’ The two children, who are now in care, were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet ‘with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests’. Mrs Justice Pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by Barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult’s abuse. But the judge said they were in fact forced by Draper and Christie to ‘provide concocted accounts of horrific events’ in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in September last year. The children’s stories came about as the result of ‘relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse’. Internet campaign: More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material . ‘Torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Christie in collaboration with Draper,’ the judge said. ‘Both P and Q have suffered significantly. Their innocence was invaded. Their minds were scrambled. Their grip on reality was imperilled.’ Tests showed they had both also ingested cannabis in the three months before being taken into care. It was impossible for analysts to say if this was via passive smoking or oral ingestion, but both children had described in interview how hemp was made into soup at their home using the juicer, the judge said. Draper took no part in the court proceedings and has ‘not been seen by anyone in authority since February 12’. There are ‘rumours that she has fled abroad’ because she fears being arrested, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. The judge completely cleared Mr Dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet ‘nothing more than utter nonsense’. ‘I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated,’ she said. ‘The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish. ‘All the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people. ‘It’s akin to the sensation, I imagine, of a Facebook user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been liked.’", "answer": ["Mother forced children to lie about sexual abuse and torture, judge rules .\nElla Draper and Abraham Christie were named in care proceedings ruling .\nMrs Justice Pauffley said the internet campaign  was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’\nShe said couple may have fed children cannabis soup to gain compliance .\nMore than four million people have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Clarke Carlisle pictured outside of court on Monday . Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence that occurred two days before the former footballer tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry. The 35-year-old, still bearing the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January, spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman, who played for Leeds United, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted a Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner, prosecutor Zahid Hussain said. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle that he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. He had been spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting a lorry on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Mr Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle, 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt in February with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital. He said he was 'disgusted' with himself and told family members he 'did not want to be here' when they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. 'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me,' he said. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you 'I still do not want to be here'.

{"question": "Man who would be President: Texas Senator Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his bid on Monday . Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for President of the United States this Monday, which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election. The Texas Republican senator, who is still in his first term of Congress, is due to commit himself to a presidential campaign at a speech in Virginia next week, according to senior advisers. Aides in the Cruz camp spoke about his intentions to the Houston Chronicle, but insisted on remaining anonymous. Cruz will hope to triumph against other GOP front-runners such as Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul to win his party's nomination. The Chronicle reported that Cruz will announce at a convocation ceremony held at Liberty University, Virginia, the world's largest Christian university. Sketching out his campaign strategy, Cruz aides said he will hope to raise more than $40million to help him compete in the primary campaign. Cruz is said to be skipping the step of forming an 'exploratory committee', which Jeb Bush has already taken, and will directly announce the bid. He will hope that his conservative credentials will play well with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, and also rely on scooping up second and third-preference votes from less convinced voters. Though he lacks the clout of other candidates within Washington and the political establishment, strategists admit, they hope that with the voters of key states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, he will be able to carry the day nonetheless. However, Cruz remains an outlier in a busy Republican field. A poll earlier this month, from Quinnipiac University, gave him 6 per cent of the GOP vote. Men to beat: Jeb Bush, left, and Scott Walker, right, both command more GOP support than Cruz. Bush has formed an 'exploratory committee' for his bid, while Walker has yet to announce . In comparison, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker took 18 per cent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush won 16, with three other hopefuls still polling better than Cruz. However wins the Republican nomination will still have to win out against the Democratic contender, most likely Hillary Clinton, to take the White House next year.

It has now emerged that Mrs Crocker, who is part of Devon and Cornwall Police's neighbourhood team in Crediton, arrived at the scene to discover the victim was her brother's son. Chief Inspector Matt Lawler said: 'Clearly this is an absolute tragedy for the entire family. 'No-one in the force knew the connection until Lisa arrived at the scene and recognised Samuel. 'There has been a great deal of support locally for Lisa and many local people have been asking if she was personally connected to the incident.

'While she has been inundated with messages, Lisa would like everyone to focus on Samuel, not on her connection to the events of last Saturday.' Emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at about 1.30pm on Saturday after Samuel was struck by the white Vauxhall Combo van. Following his death, his family led an outpouring of tributes to him. In a statement, they said: 'On Saturday afternoon our life was turned upside down when our darling Samuel was knocked down while on his way to visit his friend. 'Later that night the bright light that was Samuel was extinguished. 'We all miss our little 'mole' so much and can't begin to imagine how we move on from the devastating situation we are in now.

Gary Read, the school's headteacher, said: 'Samuel was a truly decent young boy - honest, attentive, generous, loyal and kind.

The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for £1 from passers-by to buy chips. Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games . 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.' The newspaper said hundreds of people have been in touch to offer support, and a petition has been set up on change.org to support him. A GoFundMe page set up in his name only yesterday has received more than 700 donations totalling nearly £13,000. A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, but there is assistance available for people to return home when they are not entitled to remain in the UK.'", "answer": ["Jimmy Thoronka does not want to return to his Ebola-hit west African homeland as his entire immediate family has succumbed to the disease .\nWas detained yesterday by police who found him in an emaciated state .\n20-year-old's dream to be the best sprinter in the world lies in tatters .\nBut 700 people have donated £13,000 on GoFundMe to help him out ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "An elderly couple who had been married for more than 50 years stepped in front of a speeding freight train just minutes after a row with their 50-year-old daughter, an inquest heard. Peter Smith, 80, and his wife Betty, 78, walked a short distance from their bungalow in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham, to the unmanned crossing on July 9 last year. Less than half an hour earlier, Mrs Smith and her only child, Jane, who had recently moved back in with her parents, had an disagreement over where she was keeping her belongings. Tragic: Peter Smith, 80, and his wife Betty, 78, walked a short distance from their bungalow in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham, to the unmanned crossing, pictured, on July 9 last year . Miss Smith told an inquest that as the couple left the house after the argument, her father turned to her and said: 'Goodbye, you won't see us again'. It was the last time she saw her parents. Yesterday, an inquest into their deaths at Lincoln's Cathedral Centre heard that it had 'not been an easy situation' since Miss Smith and her partner, Tim Evans had moved into the family home. In a statement read to the court, Miss Smith said she and Mr Evans had moved back in two months earlier because there was no running water in their house, The Times has reported. She said that she and her father, a former postmaster, had not had 'the best relationship over the years'. She said: that she and her mother had a disagreement over whether she could store some of her belongings in the spare room. She added: 'Later in the morning my father said that he wanted to go into town. The reason for this was that he wanted to get his glasses altered as they were hurting him.

'As they left the house my mother walked out with my father behind. 'Once my mother was out of earshot my father turned to me and said \"Goodbye, you won't see us again\". When my mother got to the gate she turned and waved at me. 'They both then turned and walked out of my sight. That was the last time I saw my parents'. The inquest heard the couple did not react when the driver of the approaching train sounded his horn, according to the Times. He applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time. The couple died almost instantly of multiple injuries. The coroner recorded verdicts of suicide. The inquest heard the couple did not have a history of mental health issues and neither had ever been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

{"question": "Dick Advocaat’s appointment as Sunderland boss seemed complete on Monday night after he told Dutch TV that he had signed a contract until the end of the season. The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats – currently one point above the relegation zone – avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen – who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg – has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats –  one point above the drop zone – avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then – the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract – which expires in 2016 – to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday.", "answer": ["Dick Advocaat will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season .\nHe will be tasked with keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League .\nIt is unlikely he will be the long-term successor to Gus Poyet with West Ham boss Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid No 2 Paul Clement in the frame .\nAdvocaat expected to be installed before Sunderland's trip to West Ham ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It has been illegal to drink alcohol on the Tube in London for seven years, but there is now a new way to enjoy cocktails on your commute. A new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from World War Two and it has been designed to resemble a vintage Underground station. Based in Carnaby Street, Cahoots, will transport guests back to the 1940s, in a bid to bring Soho’s illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life. Scroll down for video . Enjoy being able to drink on the tube! Cahoot is a 1940s themed bar opening in Soho, and transports guests back to the period, with an old tube carriage for seating, sandbags and classic cocktails . Club owners Charlie Gilkes and Duncan Stirling tried to keep the bar as authentic to how the underground would have been in the 1940s, complete with the a wooden staircase entrance in homage to the old wooden escalators . From quirky cocktails served in clocks, to the authentic vintage signs, the centrally-located bar is the brainchild of Charlie Gilkes, 30, and Duncan Stirling, 33. The pair are owners of the Bunga Bunga bar and Maggie’s nightclub, which is inspired by Margaret Thatcher and thought that as the Soho venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter, it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar. Charlie Gilkes of Inception Group said: 'We decided to open Cahoots, after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war Britain, and the venue's own extraordinary heritage. 'The site was formerly Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. 'It was also used as a bomb shelter during World War II and the wartime membership book contains names such as Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Buster Crabbe. With Cahoots we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors.' First timers are greeted by the station master, in character, at the entry kiosk and issued a ‘day ticket’ to enter the underground station . During the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick-nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids. To bring Cahoots to life, the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real London Underground fabrics, and leather from the period. They also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations. If the decor is not enough to inspire a visit, the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced £7-£9. Chose to indulge in Dig for Victory-style cocktails, drinks served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, as well as new variations of old favourites. Alternatively the impressive Cahoots signature cocktail is the Tanqueray No.TEN Station Clock, which has a working face, and serves eight for £150. Bottoms up! You are spoilt for choice at Cahoots with eight pages of cocktails including the Give Peas a Chance (£10).  Inspired by gimlets, it is made from  Goose Original vodka, garden peas, lime juice, basil, agave syrup, and a Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial NV champagne foam . When you arrive at the Soho location, you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage . Even the staff are dressed in character, with 1946 outfits, accents, nicknames with back stories as to how they came to work in the bar. Another interesting feature about the bar is the dimly-lit cosy air raid bunker seating booth, which is perfect for dates due to the snug proximity. The surroundings will be brought to life by 1940s- style singer and musicians, with possible cabaret events being put on in the near future. Cahoots is opening today in Kingly Court, W1, opens on Thursday 5 March, with free entry, and opportunities to reserve tables via the website. As well as serving classic cocktails, black market liquor and post-war favourites are also available, in particular rum and gin based drinks are furtively knocked back from old mugs, hip flasks, vintage milk bottles and tins . Those in groups are able to pass time with the Cahoots signature sharer cocktail, ‘The Tanqueray No. TEN Station Clock’, served in an actual clock with a working clock face . The cocktail list features Dig-for-victory drinks, which fit perfectly in with 1940s theme of the bar, which includes bunting, sandbags and fabric used for old underground tubes . Cahoots is located on the former site of Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. It was used as a bomb shelter during World War II . During the war, several disused underground stations were turned into air raid shelters and Londoners would transform the spaces into a ‘home away from home’, with their own nick-nacks and furnishings . The 1940s-style drinks are served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, and to do a modern twist on classic favourites .", "answer": ["Soho-based Cahoots aims to transport guests back to the war period, with themed cocktails and authentic decor .\nAmong the delights are a cocktail drank out of a clock, staff in character, and ticket booth upon your entrance .\nThe vintage tube seating area was created using old underground carriage fabrics ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)A dark intersection. A church van full of parishioners. And tragedy. That's about all police in Glades County, Florida, had to work with early Monday, hours after a van with 18 people inside ran a stop sign, crossed a four-lane highway and plunged into a shallow water-filled ditch. Eight people died. Ten others, including a 4-year-old child, were injured, according to police. Investigators don't know why it happened,  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno told CNN affiliate WPBF. The driver died, and police haven't been able to interview passengers yet. \"Our hearts go out to the families of the victims,\" Bueno said. \"It breaks your heart to see something like this happen.\" Some relatives of the crash victims, all of whom were from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God in Fort Pierce, gathered at the rural intersection Monday morning. Others went to the church. \"We've lost a lot of family members, church family,\" Phillipe Dorce, who said he lost his father, told WPBF. \"All we can do is pray (to) God to help us out. Pray for us. It's very sad for us.\" Linda Dolce told the news site TCPalm.com that her grandmother died in the crash. She'd arrived from Haiti six years ago. \"She loved singing and helping people,\" TCPalm.com quoted her as saying. \"She was exciting; she was the best lady to us.\" Laura Lochard told the site that her uncle died in the crash, leaving behind four children, the youngest of which is 16, whom he brought to the United States from Haiti. He was like a father to her, too, she said. \"It's never easy to lose a person, but I have to be strong,\" she told the site. \"I'll never forget his smile.\" A pastor at the church, Sereste Doresma told CNN that parishioners had attended a revival in Fort Myers and had left Sunday afternoon. \"This is a very difficult day for us today,\" he said. The van apparently was traveling east on State Road 78 when it ran a stop sign at U.S. Highway 27 early Monday, authorities said. It then crossed all four lanes of U.S. 27 and stopped in a ditch that was partially filled with water. No one saw the accident on the rural stretch of roadway that's frequented mostly by commercial traffic, Bueno said. One of the passengers flagged down a passing vehicle, whose driver called police, the trooper said. Police had to remove the seats of the van to remove passengers, Bueno said. Among other things, investigators are looking into the capacity of the van. It appeared to be rated for 16 passengers, Bueno said. Of the passengers, all were adults except for the 4-year-old, who was in stable condition at a  hospital, Bueno said. Two of the adult passengers were in critical condition, he said.

{"question": "(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or \"cat fight.\" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside. \"When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,\" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. \"Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.\" At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action. \"It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,\" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. \"I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.\" For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning \"How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,\" she said. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives. Even years later, the fight club is still running and is \"better than ever,\" Mazur said. \"Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,\" Mazur said. \"It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).\" Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin.

{"question": "A JetBlue Airways pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about Jesus and al-Qaeda  sued for more than $16 million Friday, claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition. The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary.

{"question": "A mother has revealed her horror after she discovered she married a paedophile. Mel Alford, of Exeter, Devon, said she only found out her husband Jonathan's past when he appeared in court to admit grooming an underage girl for sex. The 37-year-old, who has three children, first met the man she knows as JR, in April 2012 through Facebook as she was friends with his older brother. Mel Alford said she had no idea her husband Jonathan was a paedophile until he was in court . Ms Alford said she agreed to go on a date with him after he ‘kept sending nice messages’. She revealed: ‘We ended up getting engaged in August and brought the wedding forward to November that year when I found out my dad was dying from cancer. 'We were together most of the time and the start of our marriage was really good. He was great with my kids and treated me like a queen. 'I had no idea what he was really like until a social worker visited me and told me he was on bail for sleeping with an underage girl. 'That girl had come to my children's dad's house and told him and he contacted social services.' Ms Alford said that her husband denied it and pulled up what he told her was the girl's Facebook page which had a message to him saying 'sorry I lied’. Mel - pictured with Jonathan on their wedding day - said he treated her 'like a queen' She said: 'It turns out he had set up a fake account to send that message. 'Myself and the kids believed him so we just carried on. But he became so jealous after we got married and I could not answer the door in case it was a man and he would sleep outside in his car if we had a row. 'In September 2013 I kicked him out. But I didn't know the allegations were true until I saw he was in court.’ At Exeter Crown Court, Jonathan Alford admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child, seven of making or possessing indecent images of children, three of having extreme pornography and one of perverting the course of justice. Alford was also caught with child abuse and bestiality images on his computer and was jailed for seven years and three months in July last year. Ms Alford said she was totally unaware of his charges until he appeared in court and said struggled to believe that the man she loved and brought into her family was capable of such crimes. Jonathan Alford was jailed for more than seven years after he admitted admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child and other related offences . 'I went along to the court and shouted and screamed on every plea. I heard all about his sickening crimes,’ Ms Alford said. 'It was so disturbing I don't think it was really sinking in on the day. 'I walked into the middle of the court and called him a “dirty bastard”. He smiled at me and I just wanted to kill him. 'He had been brought into my family and been around my kids. I was sickened. Still all I know is what I heard in court that day. I still don't really know the full story. 'I never saw him again after that. I wanted to go to his sentencing hearing but because I had kicked off at the previous hearing the police wouldn't let me in. 'I have asked my kids if he ever tried it on with them and they have said no. But he should not have been allowed anywhere near me and my three children while he was on bail. 'There should have been checks done.' Ms Alford said she is now awaiting her final divorce papers to come through, and has set up an unofficial website to ‘name and shame’ offenders – which the police have told her to take down. She said: 'It has certainly made me a lot more cautious about people and I am passionate about what I am doing. 'I am proud to have met so many people and victims. I am not a counsellor but they tell me their story and I try and help them.’ She added: 'You have no idea who is a paedophile. I was married to one and did not know.

The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding . Fellow actor and friend Ross Sambridge, 7ft 1in tall, met Christopher at the Tall Club which he founded. Ross said 'He was a great guy, a real gent.' Matthew Uden Funeral Director from W.Uden and Sons said: 'I had the pleasure to find out about Christopher after I had a long chat with his friends, they described him as a gentle giant who had an enormous heart. 'The funeral went very well with some beautiful things being said about his life and antics, I am sure that he would have been pleased with his send off. 'Mr Greener was an extremely tall chap and we had 8 coffin bearers to carry him in to the church as opposed to the usual 4 or 6.' Mr Greener's height afforded him roles in films. Above, he is prepared for an appearance by a make-up artist . Mr Greener was buried at St Mary's Cemetery in Hayes, Bromley, earlier today and his friends described him as a 'gentle giant' Mr Greener towers over his father (left) who is stood on the front step of their home, both pictures talen in the Sixties . He held the title for 40 years and was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall. Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending. Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820. Last year Leonid Stadnyk, believed to be the world's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall, was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. Throughout his life Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had refused to be measured to determine his height because he said it would be humiliating. Among the activities Mr Greener was able to take part in was basketball where he shone on the court .

{"question": "A young woman, who had no luck when she posted an ad on Gumtree to find the father of her unborn son, is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth. Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. The 25-year-old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was Jeremy who was from the Perth suburb of Morley. As a last-ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers. Two months ago, Logan Fazey was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy. Now that life has returned to normal after the trauma, the graphic design student has continued to look for Logan's father, a fly-in, fly-out worker in his 20s, who she met at the Harlem Wednesdays night at Amplifier Capitol. Scroll down for video . Bianca Fazey continues to  search for Logan's father who she had a one-night stand with in April last year . Two months ago, Logan was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him - pictured is the first time Bianca got to touch her son . Now the little fella is fighting fit and Bianca described Logan as 'strong, smart, happy and very, very loved' Her latest appeal has seen social media users label Bianca as an unfit mother and accuse her of telling her story just for the money. 'I'm so appalled at comments that I am a bad mother and 'god help my child'. It makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long,' she said on her Facebook page. 'Yeah I am still looking, I will probably always be looking I am very curious as to who this person is and one day Logan probably will be too. 'I don't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me, it would only be between us two and not the world. ' Bianca then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews. 'For the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money, I have never accepted anything for the stories, I also have my own money, I work and I study full time, I am not this drop kick you assume me to be!' she said. 'I love this beautiful boy with all my heart and I am a fantastic mother, he is strong, smart, happy and very, very loved!' She then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of Jurien Bay - 260km north of Perth. 'Not only do I have the support of my family but also this beautiful town I live in and my amazing friends, I am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue!' she said. 'I don't know if this will be the end of this story, I will continue living my life and raising Logan just as I have been, in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list. 'Logan, my family, our health and happiness is all that matters to me.' Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son's father . Bianca's ad (pictured) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers . When Bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia in December. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.' This when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down. 'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca should have opted for a termination. 'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said. 'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby . Bianca (pictured before being pregnant) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome . Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'. 'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca has hit out at people saying she is a 'sl**', a bad mother and has only told her story for money . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.' Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life. 'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.' She still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of Logan's life .", "answer": ["Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth on April 23, 2014 .\nThe 25-year-old discovered she was pregnant and tried to find the father .\nIn a desperate last ditch attempt, Bianca posted an ad on Gumtree .\nShe only knew his name was Jeremy and lived in the suburb of Morley .\nDescribed as '5,7ish', aged in his 20s, with brown hair and brown eyes .\nShe had no luck from the ad and received some disturbing responses .\nSince having her boy two months ago who almost died, she's looking for him again now that Logan is a fighting fit and healthy baby .\nBianca has now been labelled as a bad mum who told her story for money ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Three men have been charged by police investigating disorder which marred Aston Villa's FA Cup quarter-final victory over West Brom. West Midlands Police said the men, aged between 26 and 37, had been charged with offences connected to the match after officers made a total of 17 arrests inside and outside Villa Park.

Police said Matthew Fox, 27, from Stourbridge, has been charged with assaulting a police officer and bailed to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on March 19. Meanwhile, 37-year-old Matthew Owen, a designer from Walsall, has been charged with using threatening words or behaviour with intent. He has been bailed to appear at the same court on the same date. Unemployed David Moore, 26, from Birmingham, has been charged with failing to comply with a football banning notice and was due to appear in court today. Police have also issued six men with fixed penalty notices for public order offences or being drunk and disorderly. Two other men suspected of assaulting a police officer have been bailed pending further inquiries, while a 16-year-old boy from Kingswinford, near Dudley, has been cautioned for using threatening words or behaviour. Trouble flared before, during and after the Villa Park showdown, including the pitch invasion . Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We carried out a large policing operation for the FA Cup on Saturday evening to ensure supporters could enjoy the game in a safe environment. 'An investigation has been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the Witton Arms pub. 'Anyone who saw what happened should contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.' Police say the timing of the match was fully discussed with both clubs ahead of the game. Inspector Howard Lewis-Jones added: 'We were approached by Aston Villa with the proposed later kick off time and expressed concerns that this increased the likelihood of alcohol-fuelled disorder. 'As a result we increased the policing resources to deal with this increased threat. 'The encroachment of the pitch by Aston Villa supporters was a disappointing end to an exciting local derby and we continue to work with the Football Association and the club to identify those involved.'

Yet it could have been a lot worse for the BT Sport pundit when you compare it to others that suffered similar fates when presenting by the pitch.

'Got to get some f****** brains, haven't you? No wonder he's in the f****** reserves.' Speaking with FourFourTwo in 2003, he refused to name which player he was yelling at: 'I mustn't tell you the name of the player. It wouldn't be fair. He was on shooting practice and I was standing at the corner flag when the ball hit me – that tells you everything.' At least that wasn't in front of an audience like Sportsmail's unfortunate columnist in January 2012.

The footage shows the ball getting closer and closer to its victim until it knocks her forward. Kastrop said afterwards: 'I was fine eventually. Boulahrouz ran over to me straight away and apologised.' What about in other sports? American football has its moments, too, such as when Fox reporter Pam Oliver was hit by a Chandler Harnish throw.

{"question": "Robert Durst's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of HBO's The Jinx docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways. The six part series concluded last Sunday with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. 'There it is. You're caught. Killed them all. Of course,' Durst was heard to mumble to himself. Scroll down for video . HBO's six part docudrama concluded last Sunday with eccentric millionaire Durst off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live . Durst was heard to mumble to himself 'killed them all, of course' in an unguarded moment off camera featured at the end of the final episode of HBO's The Jinx . Durst was arrested by police in New Orleans just hours before the show was broadcast and has since been charged with murder in the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. There is speculation that Durst's explosive comments could be used against him in court, but attorney Dick DeGuerin said they prove nothing. 'There's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of 'em being very Shakespearean. The soliloquy,' he told 48 Hours. Famously used by Shakespeare in a number of his plays, a soliloquy is an act of speaking one's thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers. For instance Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' speech. 'If you are a student of Shakespeare, as I am, you'll understand that what I'm talking about,' said DeGuerin. He said he first heard Durst's recorded comments 'along with the rest of America' when it was broadcast last Sunday. Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has compared his client's apparant confession to a Shakespearean soliloquy and claims that it could be interpreted in a hundred different ways . The lawyer also said that it is well know that Durst talks to himself and 'that's just one of his quirks.' 'There are people who feel like he got set up. ...My daughter's a journalist, and she was outraged at what Jarecki and his producers pulled.' DeGuerin also said he was 'astonished' that Durst was interviewed by Los Angeles prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last Saturday. 'Bob is not sophisticated, he is intelligent, he's got Asperger's,' said DeGuerin explaining why his client hadn't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present. DeGuerin filled court papers on Friday in which he claims Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, Gibbens and DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They argue that he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,' DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told KTRK-TV. DeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, right, of setting up Robert Durst . 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. He is expected to appear in court on Monday . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but he is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.", "answer": ["Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has dismissed his clients apparent confession during HBO's The Jinx docudrama .\nHe said Durst's 'killed them all' remark could be interpreted in a 100 different ways .\nEven compared his client's apparant confession to a Shakespearean soliloquy .\nDeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, of setting his client up ."], "label": "SUM"}

{"question": "A dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a £100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless. Ken Wilman thought he had found 'floating gold' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought-after ambergris on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire. But his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the U.S revealed the 'stone' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value. Scroll down for video . Ken Wilman, 52, thought he had discovered a £100,000 piece of rare whale vomit when he found this yellow-grey rock washed up on the beach in Morecambe, Lancashire, while working his dog Madge . An expert in the U.S believes that the pungent  rock has absolutely no value and is not authentic ambergris . Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is this aromatic quality which makes it is used in perfumes such as Chanel Number 5. Mr Wilman said: 'If I had my time over again, I would kick the rock to one side and walk away. I wish I'd never found it. I've got to accept what happened and get on with it.' The 52-year-old was walking his boxer dog Madge along the beach in January 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item. The highly sought-after Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem (file picture) Ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem. The substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour. The decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris, a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. It is that quality which means it is highly sought-after with perfume makers, who use it to prolong the scent of perfume. Although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today, producers usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use. As it comes from sperm whale, which is classed as a vulnerable species, cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling. But the sweet-smelling sick has been used in a variety of other ways throughout history. Ancient Egyptians reportedly found a use for it by burning ambergris as incense. The country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes. During the Black Death in Europe, worried people also thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris because the vomit masked the smell, which they thought was the root of the illness. It is rarely found on British beaches, usually being washed up in America and Australia. A French dealer offered him 50,000 Euros if it turned out to be real, while some experts said it could be worth double that quote. But the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker Peregrine Andrews -- who produced a Radio 4 show called Ken, Madge and the Strange Rock following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the Atlantic. Christopher Kemp, an American author who wrote a book about ambergris, then broke the news that it was definitely not whale vomit. To add to Mr Wilman's heartbreak, his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery. Mr Andrews said: 'He (Christopher Kemp) emailed me back and said it's definitely not ambergris, although he didn't know what it was. 'Then I had a text from Ken telling me Madge had died. He was in complete shock and then I had to tell him it wasn't real ambergris.' Mr Andrews has since contacted a dealer in New Zealand who has promised to send Mr Wilman a 2g piece of real ambergris. Although it is virtually worthless, Mr Wilman is delighted at the gesture. He said: 'When Peregrine told me, I nearly broke down. I cant believe there are nice people in the world, like this lady, who feels sorry for me and wants to send me a piece of ambergris.

{"question": "An artist has created the world's smallest sculpture only for it to be accidentally crushed by a finger while being photographed. Jonty Hurwitz's creations are so tiny they can rest on a human hair and are the same size of an ant's head. Having spent months working on the pieces, the 45-year-old from Chichester, West Sussex, took them to a photographer to have them pictured under a microscope. But within minutes his work had been destroyed by the stroke of the lab technician's finger. Scroll down for video . The world's smallest sculpture (seen in the eye of a needle, above) was accidentally destroyed by a photographer hired to help its creator capture it in pictures . The artwork, seen here on a human hair, was produced using 3D printing technolog by Jonty Hurwitz . 'I went off to have the original sculptures photographed so I found a laboratory with an electron microscope and the photographic technology,' said Mr Hurwitz. 'The technician went to change the orientation and then for the next half an hour we were looking for the piece through the lens. 'Eventually I noticed there was a fingerprint exactly where the sculpture used to be and I was like \"man you have just destroyed the smallest art pieces\" ever made - I slightly freaked out.' The sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano-painting. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope. Mr Hurwitz uses a 3D printing technology to produce them. Describing the process on his website, he said: 'The structure is created using a ground-breaking new 3D printing technology and a technique called Multiphoton Lithography. Mr Hurwitz has produced a number of nano sculptures using the same technology though the naked woman above is believed to have been the smallest . The artist from Chichester, West Sussex, described his work as a combination of 'art and Quantum Physics' 'Ultimately these works are created using the physical phenomenon of two photon absorption. Art, literally created with Quantum Physics. 'This two photon absorption occurs only at the tiny focal point - basically a tiny 3D pixel (called a Voxel). 'The sculpture is then moved along fractionally by a computer controlled process and the next pixel is created. Slowly, over hours and hours the entire sculpture is assembled pixel by pixel and layer by layer.' The sculptures are believed to be the smallest representation of the human form ever created by man.", "answer": ["Jonty Hurwitz produced the tiny sculpture which was less than 1mm tall .\nHe enlisted the help of lab technicians to photograph it under microscope .\nOne of the team accidentally crushed the artwork when photographing it .\nMr Hurwitz's sculptures are believed to be the smallest in the world ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "It rather summed up a week when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons that Rory McIlroy should find the water twice on the 18th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday. On American television over the weekend it was impossible to escape footage of him tossing his three iron into the water on Friday. Before the start of play, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the said club, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver. How typical of Trump that he plans to have the club mounted in the hotel, thereby glorifying an action that would have every regular golfer drummed out of their club if they tried it. Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the ninth fairway during the final roudn att the WGC-Cadillac Championship . McIlroy's round was shaping up nicely before his unfortunate finish on the 18th hole . The World No 1 tries to play his way out of trouble during a disappointing final round at Doral . McIlroy himself is keen to put the incident behind him and did his best with a round that was shaping up nicely until an unfortunate finish. He stood on the 18th tee tied for sixth but put his drive into the water on this brutal hole and then, after adding a penalty shot, his third shot as well. At least he didn’t lose his sense of humour. He feigned to throw another club in the drink, but this time held on to it. Through the back of the green in five, McIlroy was facing a difficult chip down the slope and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple or worse. Typical Rory. He chipped it in to the end the tournament with a more characteristic demonstration of his usual swagger. The resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top 10, though. All those missed putts, shots and water adventures therefore, and still only a handful of players beat him. Among the leaders, it was hard not to feel sorry for American JB Holmes. He began with a five-stroke lead but got his choke in early. Bubba Watson plays a shot out of a bunker on the 11th hole at Trump National Doral Blue Monster Course . There was a seven-shot swing in the first seven holes between him and Bubba Watson, leaving the Masters champion with a two-shot advantage. Watson, however, then dropped a couple of shots himself. With eight holes to play there was a three-way tie for the lead involving these two and fellow big hitter Dustin Johnson. One of the best rounds came from England’s Danny Willett, who shot 68. The 27-year-old, early leader of the Race to Dubai, is getting more comfortable at this rarefied level, and this was a fine confidence boost ahead of his first appearance at The Masters next month. The resultant top-15 finish boosted his world ranking and, as a member of the top 50, assured him of a first appearance in a regular PGA Tour event at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 10 days. He will also play the Houston Open before Augusta. Dustin Johnson winds up a shot on the 10th hole during a strong final round for the American . ‘I’m obviously very pleased,’ he said. ‘It’s a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I’d have bitten your hand off if you’d offered me that on Thursday. When you’re playing with the top 50 you know they’re not going to give you anything, but I’m feeling more comfortable all the time.’ How far can he go? One area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already. ‘I’m taking painkillers and managing it,’ he said. ‘I’m going to stay over here through the Masters because flying back and forth is no good for it. There’s no point worrying about it, I’ve just got to get on with it.’ He is doing that all right.", "answer": ["Rory McIlroy found the water twice on the 18th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral .\nThe resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71 .\nJB Holmes began brightly with a five-stroke lead but faded away .\nOne of the best rounds came from England’s Danny Willett, who shot 68 ."], "label": "SUM"}

Moores admitted that national selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott about a possible return to the Test side. England may face a West Indies side without Chris Gayle — expected to retire from international cricket after this World Cup — and many of their best players could take part in the Indian Premier League instead. England will therefore consider resting players because they have so much important cricket ahead of them, not least the establishing of what will have to be a new one-day side. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad — prime candidates to be protected from burn-out — will both resist any attempts to force them to rest. National selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott (above) about a possible return to Test cricket . Anderson is four wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham as England's leading Test wicket-taker and wants his family to join him for the first Test in Antigua in the hope he will reach the landmark there. Meanwhile, Moores on Sunday insisted he had no regrets about returning as England coach despite the huge pressure which comes with a poor showing at the World Cup. 'No regrets at all,' said Moores.

{"question": "Doctors  stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery. And in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone. A San Francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person’s breath that could hint at an underlying illness. Doctor in a stick? The very early model of the sensor (pictured) has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . Advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies. The very early model of the sensor has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released either through everyday metabolic activity, or by diseases in the body. Once created, they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food . Some compounds, including carbon for instance, are released naturally. BoydSense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal. It uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean. It is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. If the sensor is added to a smartphone, for example, a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically. In particular, the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, Mr Thuillier said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. In the MailOnline demo, the BoydSense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds . BoydSense’s boss Bruno Thuillier gave MailOnline a demo of the technology at Mobile World Congress. The current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth - although Mr Thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves. It takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise, a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous ‘sniffs’. This process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version, however. For the demo, the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges. Within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone. This was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities, but Mr Thuillier explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential. If attached to a smartphone, the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best-before date, or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn. Mr Thuillier said: ‘I am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere, anytime. This platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness. BoydSense aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics.’", "answer": ["The technology has been developed by BoydSense .\nIt recognises and analyses gases for so-called biosignatures .\nGases on the breath, for example, can be early indicators of disease .\nSensor could also reveal if food in your fridge is near its sell-by date .\nInventor hopes to add the technology to future smartphonesAnd he said sensors could be ready by the end of this year ."], "label": "SUM"}

Trevino may also face charges for several abductions and murders. Trevino's give name is Alejandro, but he has had multiple aliases and nicknames, including 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42.' The arrest of Morales comes just days after the capture of Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.

Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.' ‘Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,’ said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

{"question": "Veteran BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini has accused the police of launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities to cover up their failures over Jimmy Savile. The 65-year-old said he had suffered 'a year from hell' as officers tried to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013. He was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in October. Mr Gambaccini also claimed he had been 'left out to dry' on bail for months longer than necessary because the police did not want people to see a former Radio 1 DJ cleared before their case against his former colleague Dave Lee Travis had concluded. Scroll down for video . The 65-year-old veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini said he had suffered 'a year from hell' by officers trying to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013 . Mr Gambaccini told the Home Affairs Select Committee the police had launched a 'witch hunt' to protect their reputation . Travis was convicted of molesting a 22-year-old researcher in September, just weeks before the case against Mr Gambaccini was dropped. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Savile which exposed the police's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile. 'I faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case,' he told the Home Affairs Select Committee. He said: 'Someone whose identity we do not know, who I call the Wizard of Oz, the person sitting behind the curtain, pulling the levers, setting off smoke and light shows, decided \"I've got a great idea, let's have a witch-hunt, let's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop Jimmy Savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s''.' The furious BBC DJ added: 'When you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities, then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention.' He told MPs there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail. 'It's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame, because my name got out to the press '[but] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry.' He added: 'You don't need a witch hunt to enforce the law.' He also accused the Crown Prosecution Service of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases, such as the Rolf Harris trial, in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Jimmy Savile which exposed the police's failure to tackle abuse over decades . Mr Gambaccini told MPs he was 'left out to dry' until the end of the case against Dave Lee Travis. He also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against Rolf Harris (right) While Mr Gambaccini was making the accusation it emerged Harris had been stripped of his CBE, awarded to him by the Queen . The 84-year-old Australian was awarded the CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven-years-old. Mr Gambaccini said he had lost faith in the British justice system and revealed he had lost £200,000 in wages and legal fees after his arrest. The US-born DJ was re-bailed several times during his ordeal – and only found out about one after it had been reported to the BBC and ITV. Mr Gambaccini accused the CPS of having 'sat on the case' for eight months and said he 'enthusiastically' supports 28-day bail limit. He said the only reason for delay is to 'get someone else to accuse you'. Mr Gambaccini had his bail extended  when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for indecent assaults . He told the committee that during that time, his bail was extended on seven occasions with only 'vague' explanations from police, but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the Yewtree investigation. Bail was extended on May 2, when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults, on June 30, hours after the conviction of Rolf Harris and on September 12, when former Stoke Mandeville doctor Michael Salmon appeared in court charged with rape, he said. 'You know what they say. Twice is a coincidence, three times is a trend,' said Mr Gambaccini. 'It was kind of interesting when I was rebailed the same day Max Clifford was sentenced. It was kind of infuriating when I was rebailed the same day Rolf Harris was convicted. But then when I was rebailed again when Michael Salmon was charged, I thought 'OK, what they are doing here is trying to bury the news of my being rebailed forever, because if anybody wanted to write an article about Yewtree on those days, it wouldn't be about me, it would be about the other suspects'.' When his bail was extended to September 15, he suspected a link to the trial of Dave Lee Travis, which was due to end on that date. 'I thought, 'This is the most obvious thing in the world. They are sitting on me until they are finished with Travis, because they don't want the Travis jury to know that a former Radio 1 DJ can be innocent'. 'I do believe - though I don't have any evidence for this - that they were just sitting on me until Travis was finished,' he said. The veteran disc jockey told MPs that no one was above the law, but said celebrities were more vulnerable to false allegations because more people know them. He added: 'This person went after me because I was the famous person in his neighbourhood.' After dropping their case against him, the CPS revealed that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations. Paul Gambaccini accused the police for launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities . Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 'You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there. 'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 'I've been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity. 'This comes out when he's dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I'm not talking about personal life.'

McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 .

'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded.

Large bottles of the expensive Dom Perignon champagne are buried into an ice bucket . Jimmy Bullard (pictured here in 2011) was one of the investors, and is thought to have lost around £600,000 . McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.'

Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said: 'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000 . McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007 . 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

{"question": "Stuart McCall insisted Rangers had earned a vital psychological boost in the battle to follow Hearts into the Premiership after recording a breakthrough 2-0 win over Hibs. The Ibrox outfit had lost all three previous Championship meetings with Alan Stubbs’ men by a crushing 9-1 aggregate scoreline, but turned the tables at Easter Road in a result which also meant the Tynecastle club were officially promoted as second-tier champions. Goals from Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller — the latter strongly disputed by Hibs — gave McCall a first win in charge and hoisted the Rangers to within three points of their second-placed hosts with a game in hand. Stuart McCall celebrates watching his side beat Hibernian 2-0 at Easter Road on Sunday . There is a fair chance the two sides could meet again in the play-offs and McCall admitted it was essential his side stopped the rot against their Leith rivals. ‘First and foremost I would like to congratulate Hearts on an outstanding season and winning the title,’ said the Ibrox boss, who drew his first two matches in charge. ‘Robbie Neilson and his team have been outstanding all season, so fair play to them. ‘I am delighted with our performance and the result but it’s only one game, we won’t get carried away. But it will restore a bit of confidence that has been severely lacking. ‘It’s a stepping stone. But if we are to hopefully get back into the top league at the end of the season then we’re likely going to have to play Hibs in a decider. ‘If we had come here and got beat today then psychologically it wouldn’t have been good, so this will help. But we have a long way to go. ‘We want to go into the play-offs with momentum, with a bit of spirit and confidence and players playing at the level they can play.’ Rangers had drawn their five previous games and travelled to Easter Road on the back of just one win in nine. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Wallace slams home the opener just before half-time to put the away side in control at Easter Road . That dire run had left Ibrox fans despairing about their promotion hopes but McCall, who earned joy from switching to a 3-5-2 shape, feels his team have now shown they are good enough to go up. ‘Yes, that’s all we want from them,’ he said. ‘Whatever is past has now gone — even today has now gone. There are players in there who need a bit of belief and confidence. A performance like today can only help. ‘I said to the players, there is only one thing better than winning and that is winning as an underdog, when people don’t expect it of you. There is a long way to go and we won’t be getting carried away but it helps with the confidence, morale and belief.’ Rangers fans chanted McCall’s name as the minutes ticked away at Easter Road but he played down the formation rejig that drew a radically improved display. ‘Listen I am no master tactician or anything like that,’ he said. ‘We played a shape and it worked but that was down to the players who carried out what we wanted them to do. ‘You can talk about formations and tactics, whatever, but the bottom line is if the players show the desire and the willingness and the ability like they did today, then it’s about players and them doing the jobs they are asked to do. To a man, they did that today.’ Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian .", "answer": ["Rangers closed the gap on Hibs to just three points in the Championship .\nLee Wallace scored the opening goal for Rangers after 44 minutes .\nKenny Miller sealed the tie in the closing minutes with a tidy finish .\nClick here for all the latest Rangers news ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "'Devastating' head injuries: Austen Harrison, four, had been playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror . A four-year-old boy died from ‘devastating’ head injuries when an unstable shop mirror fell on him, an inquest heard today. Austen Harrison, of Turners Hill, West Sussex, was playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror while his father tried on a suit at a Hugo Boss shop when it toppled over and crushed him. He underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain following the incident in Oxfordshire, but died four days later in hospital after life-support was switched off. An inquest into his death at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance. Austen was with his parents, Simon and Irina Harrison, when the incident happened at the Bicester outlet village at around 8.30pm on June 4, 2013. Mrs Harrison and her son met Mr Harrison after he finished work and had dinner at a Carluccio's restaurant before going to the Hugo Boss store. In evidence read to the jury of seven men and two women by Darren Salter, the senior coroner for Oxfordshire, Mr Harrison said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets while his wife and son wandered around. As he tried on various suits Austen came in to the changing area and began looking at himself in a large mirror and playing with its large winged sections, attached to the main mirror with hinges. Mr Harrison, a mechanical aerospace engineering consultant, said he moved the mirror's wings himself as he looked at a suit, moving them out to an angle of about 45 degrees. Accident scene: An inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall of the Hugo Boss store in Bicester (above) and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance . Giving evidence: Simon Harrison (left, today), the boy's father, said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets. Pictured (right) is a closed sign following the incident . He said: ‘I didn't have any concerns because I assumed they would be fixed to the wall. I couldn't think of any reason why such a large mirror wouldn't be fixed to the wall.’ But as he tried on another suit and walked to his wife to try on a tie, they heard an extremely loud bang, ‘as if something had fallen over’, and someone gasp. He said: ‘I instantly knew Austen was lying underneath it, as it was not lying flat on the floor.’ Mr Harrison went straight over and lifted the mirror from his son, who was lying motionless. He said: ‘He was lying face up with his legs straight out and his arms by his side.’ Treatment: Austen was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford, where he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain . Mr Harrison carried his son into the main part of the shop, where an off-duty doctor assisted, but after he was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain. Doctors told the family Austen would not recover from the ‘irreversible’ brain damage. Life support was switched off and he died at 5.45am on June 8. In his statement, Mr Harrison told the inquest that while his son was in hospital he went back to the shop and told managers he was in a critical condition. Mr Harrison said he asked the manager if he had viewed the CCTV footage, and was told it showed Austen pulling the mirror off the wall. The inquest continues.

{"question": "Alan Stubbs has lambasted Willie Collum over the referee’s role in the goal that sealed a 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road. The Hibernian boss was astonished that Collum didn’t award a free-kick after Lee Wallace appeared to foul Paul Hanlon as the centre-half sought to clear. Kenny Miller seized the loose ball and, with the home defence still appealing for an infringement, cracked home an 80th-minute shot that added to Wallace’s opener. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs speaks to the fourth official; he was unhappy with the referee's performance . Referee Willie Collum was on the end of some stick from Hibs boss Stubbs after their game against Rangers . Stubbs attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but couldn’t disguise his anger towards Collum, who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season. ‘Can I say no comment in case I get into any trouble?’ Stubbs opened. ‘I’ve been in management a short time. I was a player a long time. Over the years, that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time. ‘I think that’s probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble. ‘Not 90 per cent, not 99 per cent, 100 per cent. But a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently. Stubbs was sure that a foul on Paul Hanlon (right) would have been given '100 per cent' of the time . Stubbs (centre) watches on from the dugout as his Hibs side fell to a 2-0 defeat by Rangers . ‘When he sees it back again... well, there’s no point. He’s there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very, very wrong. ‘There was no point speaking to him afterwards. Everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul. ‘I don’t want to sit here and try to justify a decision. Only one guy can do that, but he’s protected and not allowed to talk. It spoiled the game, although obviously not from Rangers’ point of view.’ Hanlon was booked for his protests towards Collum as Rangers celebrated Miller’ s first goal since December. ‘Most of the stadium felt it was a foul,’ said the defender. ‘I thought it was but the referee thought differently. Kenny Miller (centre) celebrates after his goal gave Rangers an unassailable 2-0 lead over Hibs . Miller is mobbed by the ecstatic Rangers supporters who had made the trip to Easter Road on Saturday . ‘I read the pass, got in front of Wallace and went to clear with my right foot. I just felt like I was taken out. ‘It’s disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game. ‘I wasn’t given an explanation, he (Collum) just decided to book me for dissent even though I didn’t say much. ‘I just said it was a foul, along with everyone else who surrounded him. ‘I didn’t even think I was in his face but I think he just has to pick a player and book him.’", "answer": ["Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller scored as Rangers beat Hibernian 2-0 .\nThat result leaves Rangers three points behind Hibs with a game in hand .\nHibs boss Alan Stubbs was unhappy with the referee's performance .\nHe was astonished Collum didn't award Hibs a free-kick in the build-up ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)When American writer Avijit Roy was hacked to death on a Dhaka, Bangladesh, street in full view of horrified onlookers, blogger Washiqur Rahman doubled down. Fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation, he wrote. But they couldn't silence it. His friends warned him to be careful, to watch what he posted online. But Rahman dismissed those concerns, saying his Facebook profile page didn't even bear his picture. They don't even know what I look like, he told them. On Monday, the 27-year-old Rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed Roy, hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency. He was so maimed -- with wounds to his head, face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying. His death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in Dhaka for online posts critical of Islam -- but they are hardly the only two who've paid a steep price. In the last two years, several  bloggers have died, either murdered or under mysterious circumstances. \"The despicable murder of Avijit Roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk. The killing of Washiqur Rahman today is another clear example of the Bangladeshi government's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk,\" said Abbas Faiz of  Amnesty International. \"How many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken?\" As shocking as Rahman's death was, the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing. On his Facebook page (for which he picked a custom URL that translates to \"unbeliever\"), Rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag #IamAvijit. After his death, someone left a comment, \"Now you are.\" Another wrote, \"I felt sorry when I first learned of your death. But then I saw what you wrote and I am not.\" On his page, Rahman reposted a cartoon depicting Prophet Mohammed from the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo. He wished a happy birthday to author Taslima Nasreen, who was forced to flee Bangladesh due to death threats from fundamentalists. And he \"liked\" a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned, \"Pigs in burqas.\" Posts threatening him were numerous. \"Get ready for the afterlife,\" one person commented on one of his posts. \"See you in hell,\" said another. He used to write under the pseudonym \"Stupid Man\" on a blog but switched to posting on Facebook after 2011. On Facebook, he is credited for a series, \"Jaw-crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists.\" There, he posted questions that critics of Islam often raised and then answered them. But he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within Islam. For example, one question asked what proof was there that the Quran was the word of God. The answer, \"Mohammed said in his own words that the Quran is the word of God. Since Mohammed is the messenger of Allah, his claims are true.\" He placed the question next to one that asked, \"What is the proof that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah?\" The answer, \"The Quran claims that Mohammed was the messenger of Allah. And since the Quran is God's word, its claims must be true.\" Asif Mohiuddin, a blogger who himself was wounded by machete-wielding attackers in 2013 but survived, remembered Rahman as a great satirist. \"I named him the George Carlin of Bangladesh,\" he told the International Humanist and Ethical Union. \"He wanted with all his heart, a true secular country, where everyone can practice their freedom.\" The irony is that the people who killed Rahman weren't even familiar with his writings; they were simply following orders, police said. Of the three involved in the Monday morning attack, two were quickly caught by bystanders. In confessions to police, the pair -- both students at Islamic schools -- said they didn't know what a blog was, nor had they seen Rahman's writing. They said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing Rahman was a religious duty, Police Commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarkar told reporters. The third person is still to be apprehended. That appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in Bangladesh. The only person arrested in the killing of Roy, the U.S. blogger, is Farabi Shafiur Rahman, who had called for his death in Facebook posts. There has been no conviction in the January 2013 attack on Mohiuddin. And no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, also in 2013. \"The Bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others,\" the Committee to Project Journalists said after Rahman's death. \"Otherwise the rest of the country's bloggers, commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well.\" Bloggers, unlike political parties, aren't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals, said Imran Sarker, who heads the Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh. \"They want peace, they talk of humanity. If you strike them with stones, they don't strike back. They try to reach you with flowers,\" he said. \"So, if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought, they are easy to pick on.\" But the deaths -- of Rahman, of Roy, of Haider -- have emboldened the movement, rather than chill them into silence. \"No one is cowering in their homes because this is happening. Because this has been happening regularly for a long time,\" he said. \"We want to take the society forward. We know we have a lot left to accomplish.\" CNN's Omar Khan, Kunal Sehgal and Ravi Agrawal contributed to this report.", "answer": ["The 27-year-old Rahman falls victim to the same brazen act that killed Avijit Roy .\nThe deaths have emboldened the movement, an activist says ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease . A grandmother claims she was left 'looking like Nanny McPhee' after 13 of her teeth fell out due to dodgy dental treatment. Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease. Her grandchildren likened her appearance to the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. As a result, she was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. Now Mrs Walkden, a telesales worker from Preston, Lancashire, has won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave, 57. She said: 'I had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted. 'I looked like somebody who had been in a car crash. I had black eyes, swollen mouth and I couldn't eat for a week. It's ruined my life. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. 'My grandchildren would call my Nanny McPhee when I didn't have my dentures in because I had just one tooth at the top.' Mrs Walkden had been a patient of Dr Musgrave at the Preston-based Incisive Dental Practice for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months. She said: 'During these years I didn't think anything was wrong. I'd get the all clear. 'Or I would say I was having problems and he would say he would have a poke around and say its fine and to see him in six months. 'If there were problems or a tooth was twinging, he would look at it or find a cavity and say it needs filling. I trusted him implicitly. Whatever he said, I believed. She added: 'As far as I know he did a routine check but he never told me I had gum disease. He never offered for me to see a hygienist.' The truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when Mrs Walkden's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist. To her horror, it emerged her teeth were rotting from the inside out. She said: 'When I went to see him the first thing he said was \"when was the last time you went to the dentist?\". 'When I said \"3 months ago\", he said \"that's not what your teeth are telling me\". 'I was completely shocked. We cut our holiday short and came home. 'I went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed I was going to lose all my top set of teeth.' 'You can't imagine the reaction when someone tell you they will have to take all your teeth out. It was horrible. 'They asked if I wanted to sit down.. It was a feeling that was absolutely horrendous. I had 13 teeth removed. 'I also had a wisdom tooth on the bottom removed that was beyond saving and had to have an implant to replace that wisdom tooth.' Despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years, Mrs Walkden was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed . Her grandchildren likened her appearance to Nanny McPhee, the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. Mrs Walkden, had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed. She said: 'I had to go through a few treatments of that. I have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it's very high powered. It was like torture but it had to be done. 'Then I went to have my teeth extracted, all but 4 at first. They fitted me there and then with a partial denture.' 'I had to get used to something so alien in my mouth and learn how to speak again as it changes the shape of your mouth. I didn't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time.' Mrs Walkden eventually underwent implant surgery in April 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week. She said: 'I have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and I have only been left with around £11,000 for pain and suffering. 'Compensation is not a \"pay out\". No amount of money can compensate for having lost my teeth. 'The money I've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds I have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work. 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now.' She added: 'This is all because this dentist didn't do proper checks. If he had done X-rays he would have known. It is basically negligence. 'I put the time in going to the dentists and I expected to be taken care of. If you look at the dentists records you see check-up after check-up every 6 months. You just don't expect to end up going through this.' 'I felt utterly betrayed by Dr Musgrave when I found out the extent of the damage to my teeth and gums. 'I've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment. Mrs Walkden was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. She has now won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave . She said: 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now' 'I thought I was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members. It was wrong to assume that my dentist's inclusion on the insurance register was a quality guarantee. 'It ruined my confidence. In that situation you just don't want to go anywhere - it's horrendous. It does nothing for your confidence and leaves you very self-conscious.' Associate solicitor, Heather Owen at the Dental Law Partnership which represented Mrs Walkden said: 'Alexandra's case was one of long-term mistreatment, compounded by a string of failures by her dentist Dr Musgrave. 'He routinely failed to check the health of her teeth, screen for gum disease, remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care. 'At no point was the patient advised of alternative treatment options or referred to specialists when her oral health started to decline.'

{"question": "They like Manchester band The Courteeners at Old Trafford. Upon winning their 20th Premier League title fans had the words of their song 'Not Nineteen Forever' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the Theatre of Dreams. But in the case of forgotten man Ander Herrera and his triumphant return to the side, the Middleton four-piece's earlier hit 'What Took You So Long?' would be more appropriate. Ander Herrera (centre) is starting to make an impact for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side . Herrera has forged a strong bond with fellow Spaniard Juan Mata, who scored twice against Liverpool . What took you so long Louis van Gaal? Why was Herrera, suddenly a key player in United's new-found swagger, out of the picture for long chunks of the season? There is more than one answer. Firstly, if anyone is a 'club signing' it is Herrera. Long before the coronation of King Louis, United originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in Athletic Bilbao' 2011-12 Europa League victory over Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The admiration from within spread to the stands. They have never been shy of praising opponents at Old Trafford – this was where, in 2003, Ronaldo famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful Champions League hat-trick for Real Madrid. The 25-year-old was signed from Athletic Bilbao in a £28.8million move following Van Gaal's arrival . Herrera made a bright start to his United career, but injury saw the Spaniard sidelined for several weeks . In that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer David Moyes famously made one attempt to capture Herrera's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player's contract could not be overcome. But they would not give up. When Van Gaal arrived talks were at an advanced stage with Herrera's representatives and he was happy to give the £28.8m move the green light with the new season approaching. United have paid more for only four others, but as we have heard more than once, under Van Gaal's philosophy the fee counts for nothing. Former United boss David Moyes made an attempt to capture Herrera's services, but failed . The Spanish midfielder is having to prove his worth to Van Gaal during his first season at Old Trafford . Herrera celebrates scoring during United's FA Cup fifth round victory against Preston in February . Not being the Dutchman's player, Herrera may have had to prove himself more than most. In a stuttering start to the season, he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half-time against West Bromwich Albion. As late as February he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5-3 humbling at Leicester City in September. With their team struggling for rhythm United fans who remembered Herrera conducting the tune for Bilbao, scratched their heads at his continued absence. When he made a rare start in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Deepdale on February 16 many put it down to Van Gaal's squad rotation. Herrera's partnership with Daley Blind (right) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield . But Herrera has started every game since, the kickstarting of his Old Trafford career coinciding with United finally clicking into gear. His partnership with Daley Blind has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield. Suddenly United appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors. Herrera's through ball for Juan Mata to open the scoring against Liverpool came in a dominant half of football United fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago. But there is more to it than Herrera simply not being the boss's signing. In a wide-ranging interview with El Pais, he offered more clues. Herrera and Mata chase down Philippe Coutinho during United's 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Sunday . Mata puts the ball past Simon Mignolet for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from Herrera . 'Van Gaal loves possession and doesn't like to risk [losing] the ball,' he said. 'He wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place, because the team have the quality to find you. 'At the beginning he used to tell me off because I always looked for the ball, I wanted to have it, and I must wait for it.' Van Gaal is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff – that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win. Michael Carrick (left) congratulates Herrera on the part he played in Mata's opening goal . It is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the NFL by New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, whose team this year won their fourth Super Bowl this century. While it does not sound like the famous United Way, it certainly looked like it at Anfield. Herrera, superb on Merseyside, believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism.

Dutch YouTube jokers lifehunterstv took a £7(10 euro) print and placed it in an art museum in Arnhem, and asked visitors what they thought of the 'painting' and how much it could be worth. Several art fans praised the IKEA print, with some valuing it to £1.8million(2.5million euro), before being told of the hoax. Funny guys: A group of Dutch YouTube jokers took a £7 print from IKEA and placed it in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem . The team from lifehunterstv placed the cheap canvas on display in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem, and asked art lovers for an appraisal. They told visitors the painting was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews', and, according to the pranksters, all of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie. The video shows presenter Boris Lange talking about the painting to a number of visitors, who call the cheap print 'modern' and 'shocking'. One man praises the print for its 'constructiveness of things on top of each other, inside each other'. Another  visitor, a man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism', adding that the artist has a 'beautiful spirit'.

A man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism' When asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth, one guesses 'over 1,000 euro', while another says: 'If you could buy this for 2.5million euros, I'd do it.' 'The whole day everyone thought our \"painting\" amazing,' the team behind the prank says. 'When the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit, and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside!' When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side, but, lifehunterstv reveals, not all were pleased about being duped.

{"question": "When Nick Clegg walked out of today's farcical ‘yellow budget’ speech, it prompted relentless jeers from Labour MPs - and left Danny Alexander speaking to a virtually-empty chamber. And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend. As these pictures show, the Liberal Democrat leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around Kent, taking selfies with residents and high-fiving passers-by as part of a 'fun' film shoot for a party political broadcast.

Am-dram: He also practised his best acting outside a nail art studio (left) and with another selfie taker (right) Wearing dark woollen gloves, an open-neck shirt and a navy v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home as he laughed and joked with residents, putting on his best smiling face for the cameras and occasionally treating them to an embrace. There were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film. At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the political broadcast is not the first time that Mr Clegg has attempted some amateur acting. The politician is said to have enjoyed Am-dram at school, taking the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott. At Westminster,  he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter. In one scene, she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically. 'She got it spot on… no acting was required,' Clegg recalls.

{"question": "He's the internet-savvy modern leader who cuddles up to kittens and hobnobs with film stars on his wildly popular Instagram page. But Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov is also a former warlord accused of running the Russian republic 'like a medieval tyrant'. The 38-year-old came to power in 2007 after a vicious armed struggle with a number of other Chechen strongmen and a political battle with the man he succeeded as leader, Alu Alkhanov. Claims that Kadyrov keeps a 'murder list' of 300 names of people to be liquidated surfaced in 2008. Yet the brutal reality of how Kadyrov maintains his grip on power has been glossed over by his social media skills and voracious appetite for posting on Instagram. Scroll down for video . Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov with actress Liz Hurley and a kitten. The Austin Powers star was in Grozny to shoot thriller Turquoise when the snap was taken in May 2013 . Kadyrov in medieval garb.

Kadyrov is a fan of the big cats . The father-of-eight has uploaded more than 4,800 posts and has around 905,000 followers to his kadyrov_95 account on the photo-sharing site. He has shown a particular fondness for snaps of himself with cute fluffy kittens, baby birds, lambs and even tigers. In May 2013 he posted snaps of himself with Liz Hurley and a white kitten on Instagram after meeting the actress when she arrived in Chechnya to film thriller Turquoise with French actor Gerard Depardieu. The pair were seen  apparently bonding over the tiny animal having been introduced by Kadyrov's friend Depardieu. In another shot the Chechen strongman leans across the Austin Powers star and runs his finger over the smartphone she is holding as the two appear perfectly at ease with each other. Depardieu met the Chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years previously and later controversially accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires.

The burly enforcer has a go at playing the world's biggest softy as he lovingly cups a baby chick in his enormous hands. And the shots of him with a tiger are probably the most bizarre of all, as he pillows his head on the young big cat on top of an ornate rug and has it on his lap with a lead around its neck as he sits between two associates. And yet this is the man whose widely feared 'Kadyrovtsy' militia several thousand-strong, are accused by human rights groups of involvement in kidnappings, assassinations and torture throughout their patron's rise to power. They were formed during the first Chechen war for independence between 1994 and 1995 when Kadyrov's father, Chechnya's Grand Mufti or highest Islamic official, declared jihad against Russia.

But the Kadyrov clan switched their allegiance to Moscow at the beginning of the second Chechen war in 1999, since when continued insurgents against the Kremlin have been ruthlessly dealt with by the militia. The paramilitary clashed with forces loyal to fellow warlord Sulmin Yamadayev in March 2008 and a year later Kadyrov's rival was dead, assassinated in Dubai in a hit reputedly ordered by one of Kadyrov's cousins. The son of assassinated former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov also prevailed in his fight with paramilitary leader Said-Magomed Kakiyev, while Kadyrov successfully angled for Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismiss Alkhanov and appoint him leader instead. Since then it is widely accepted that Putin has given Kadyrov carte blanche to run Chechnya as his own personal fiefdom, provided he keeps the separatist forces which temporarily ripped the republic from the Kremlin's grasp in the 1990s are kept in check. Aside from Yamadayev a string of other Kadryov opponents have wound up dead in locations stretching from Moscow to Istanbul and Vienna, though the man himself has always denied involvement in any of their killings. Kadyrov hugs a man in a bear suit in front of the neon backdrop of the Chechen capital Grozny's skyline . The former warlord posted this viral video of a panda rolling down a snow covered hill on his Instagram page . This short film of pandas on a slide at the Chengdu Panda Base in China was another posted by Kadyrov . The video has more than 9million times on Youtube, and likely picked up some of those thanks to Kadyrov . Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in the capital in October 2006 while she was reportedly working on a story about torture and human rights abuses in Chechnya. Some observers laid the blame for the killing at Kadyrov's door. A month later Movladi Baisarov, a former commander of the Chechen presidential security services turned Kadyrov opponent, was also shot dead in Moscow. He had branded Kadyrov 'a medieval tyrant', adding: 'If someone tells the truth about what is going on, it's like signing one's own death warrant. 'Ramzan is a law unto himself. He can do anything he likes. He can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her. 'Ramzan acts with total impunity. I know of many people executed on his express orders and I know exactly where they were buried.'

{"question": "(CNN)It was nothing if not predictable. Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new \"religious freedom\" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. \"Libs SHUTUP,\" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's \"Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)\" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. \"My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,\" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. \"We stand against discrimination.\" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL.

{"question": "Scared for her life: Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is under police protection in Ukraine after reporting a 'threat to her life from unidentified individuals' Ukraine has put the girlfriend of slain Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov under state protection after she received death threats. Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, is now under the guard of SBU secret services and the police. Kiev also said today that she would not return to Moscow over the probe into the death of the Vladimir Putin foe. 'We will not let her go back to Russia,' said Anton Geraschenko, an aide to the Interior Minister. 'If Russian investigators need to talk to her, they will have to come to Ukraine.' The announcement came as another of Russia's leading opposition figures vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by as he walked free from a 15-day spell in jail. Alexei Navalny, who had been convicted of handing out leaflets calling for an opposition rally, said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder seven days ago. Emerging unshaven from a Moscow detention centre this morning, Mr Navalny said: 'This act of terror hasn't achieved its goal, it will not frighten me or my comrades. We will not reduce our efforts, we will not step back.' A key figure in Boris Yeltsin's 1990s government, Mr Nemtsov was the most prominent figure in Russia's liberal opposition to be killed during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule. The 55-year-old was shot four times in the back by a gunman in a passing car as he walked hand-in-hand with Miss Duritskaya on a bridge across the Moskva River on Friday night, in the shadow of central Moscow's St Basil Cathedral. The Ukrainian woman - physically unhurt in the attack - revealed the death threats to police in Kiev, who said today they were providing her with protection. 'On March 5, Anna Duritskaya, who is a witness in the case in the murder of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, turned to the Ukrainian police in the Kiev Region with a statement on a threat to her life from unidentified individuals,' said the prosecutor-general's office in Ukraine. The statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats, according to the Associated Press. The model was staying with her parents since returning to her home country. A relative in Ukraine said she was 'in a bad mental state'. In the aftermath of Mr Nemtsov's assassination, Miss Duritskaya was repeatedly questioned by Russian investigators, and she complained that she was held under armed guard and unable to leave the country. However, she returned to Ukraine last week. 'This act of terror will not frighten me or my comrades': Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said he would continue his staunch criticism of Vladimir Putin's government despite the Mr Nemtsov's murder .

As thousands gathered in Moscow to pay their last respects at Mr Nemtsov's funeral, Putin insisted the Russian law enforcement authorities would do 'everything' to solve the crime. However, Nemtsov's eldest child, Zhanna Nemtsova, 30, revealed that investigators had not spoken to a single member of his close family six days after the murder. They believe his 'cruel and barefaced murder' was because of his political opposition to the Kremlin. Yesterday a top Nato official suggested Putin was responsible for Mr Nemtsov's death as he accused the Russian president of silencing dissent at home while seeking to turn Ukraine into a failed state. 'We've seen that the victims are not just in eastern Ukraine, with the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov last Friday,' NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow said. Speaking to members of parliament from EU countries at a conference in Riga, Mr Vershbow went on: 'While we don't know who pulled the trigger, we do know that Boris Nemtsov was a powerful voice for democracy and against Russia's involvement in Ukraine ... (and) was among those vilified as \"traitors\" and \"fifth columnists\" in Russia's official propaganda.'

He was Russia's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency, but found himself on the fringes of the country's politics after a tanking economy forced Yeltsin's resignation. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. In January 2011, he was sentenced to 15 days in jail after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. Murder: Flowers lie at the scene of Mr Nemtsov's murder, while police divers search the Moskva River for the gun that was used to gun him down. He was a key figure in Russia's liberal, pro-West opposition . Pro-West in his ideology, Mr Nemtsov had told U.S. diplomats he wanted to take Russia on a pro-EU, pro-Nato course, including eventual membership of both organisations, according to a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks. 'The key, Nemtsov argued, was to present this strategy as the only viable choice for Russia,' wrote a U.S. embassy attaché in the note dated February 2006. But, the diplomat continued, 'Nemtsov also realizes that his association with the Yeltsin era will probably limit support for any initiative with his name on it, and he is counting on the next generation of politicians to carry the liberal banner.' Putin has claimed Mr Nemtsov's murder - yards from the Kremlin - was a 'provocation'.", "answer": ["Anna Duritskaya, 23, told police she had received anonymous threats .\nShe was with Boris Nemtsov, 55, when he was gunned down in Moscow .\nNow back in Ukraine, she had complained she was being held in Russia .\nNemtsov family reveals they have had no contact from murder detectives ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "When Cristiano Ronaldo started the year with a Ballon d'Or award nobody thought 2015 could ever turn into his annus horribilis. But since his 'Siiii!' war cry in Zurich when he collected the trophy and sent an 'I'm coming for you' message to Lionel Messi, the Real Madrid forward's fortunes have been in free-fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to Manchester United has been opened once again. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio his player would go on scoring goals for Real Madrid until he is 40 as the club and the player's entourage celebrated his well-deserved gong in January. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo sits on the Bernabeu pitch during his side's 2-0 win against Levante . The former Manchester United man endured a frustrating evening despite his side's La Liga victory . Ronaldo has a shot at goal on Sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net . But since then he has been sent off and banned for two games; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by Atletico Madrid and pledged a vow of silence after the team's defeat in the Champions League to Schalke. Manchester United have been linked with both a bold move for Gareth Bale or a romantic return for Ronaldo. Sources in Madrid now say of the two moves, it would be a bid for Ronaldo that would meet with less resistance. For all the boos and whistles for Gareth Bale from sections of the Santiago Bernabeu crowd the club president Florentino Perez is firmly behind his £86million signing and sees him as Ronaldo's heir apparent. Ronaldo is even understood to have done more to help the former Tottenham forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year's Ballon d'Or podium. The request was not received with open arms. Much like Bale when he scored twice on Sunday against Levante. Gareth Bale celebrates after opening the scoring but Ronaldo appeared frustrated that he hadn't found the net . Ronaldo celebrates winning the Premier League title with Manchester United shortly before leaving in 2009 . A return to Old Trafford is not out of the question for the Portuguese superstar after a miserable start to 2015 . Real Madrid trio Ronaldo, Bale and Karim Benzema share an embrace after the Welshman's second goal . Bale, pictured with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones, is seen as the heir to Ronaldo by Florentino Perez . Ronaldo failed to celebrate his team-mate's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six-yard area. Like the incredible sulk of old, Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound. Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.' He was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points. And with those two goals for Bale and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game, including one sitter in injury-time and a weak shot from a perfect Bale cross in the first half, Ronaldo went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not to the centre circle to applaud supporters. Ronaldo split up with his long-term girlfriend, Russian model and actress Irina Shayk, in January . Ronaldo's form has dipped since his split and Lionel Messi now has more goals than him this season . Irina accompanied Ronaldo to the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards in January 2014 but she was absent this year . Off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from Russian girlfriend Irina Shayk ensuring he has filled the pages of many of Spain's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be. All this with the Clasico on the horizon – a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than Messi who now has two more than his rival. Last year Ronaldo raced to a 12-goal lead over Messi who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager Luis Enrique. Messi's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year. Things change so quickly in Spanish football and Ronaldo's last three months are evidence of that. What also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the Bernabeu Ronaldo could yet find time in his record-breaking career to go back to Old Trafford for a glorious swansong.

{"question": "(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. \"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,\" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. \"It couldn't be done without it.\" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker \"The Money Man\" or \"TBE\" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. \"I think they're both playing their roles,\" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. \"You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of Mayweather? \"If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, \" says Sauerland. \"But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need  a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history.\" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the text -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. \"Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,\" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. \"If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,\" McLaren says. \"So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer.\" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. \"A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,\" he says. \"If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer.\" Sauerland agrees. \"Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar.\" \"It'll be an interesting fight,\" adds McLaren, \"just because they are so different.\"", "answer": ["Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao bout set to be the largest purse in boxing history .\nFighters take to social media to boost  viewership .\nInstagram accounts highlight personality clash ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "(CNN)With the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager Tony Robinson in Madison, Wisconsin, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, it's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point. And the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve. To approach things from a more positive angle, the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative. The best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse. This unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems, which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them. When things are going wrong, responsible people can begin by saying the right things. President Obama said on Twitter, \"Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together.\" The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying, \"The CBC understands the frustrations in Ferguson, but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country.\" And Attorney General Eric Holder noted, \"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. ... This was a damn punk, a punk who was trying to sow discord.\" For the most part, authorities in Missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters. Surely, not all responses have been as measured, but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people. While we pause for a moment to let passions cool, we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination. The way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community's real concerns. And it's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces. This approach would benefit both the community and the police. I'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations, as noted in the DOJ report on Ferguson. Nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent. One of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats. Officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass. Being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them. The cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies, he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve. Another idea is to give cops bicycles, which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community. Lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the DOJ report on Ferguson. In areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide, mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together. After all, both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods. Both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level.  A tech services company in the South Bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood. The event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like \"basically they're like us.\" Ultimately, police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike. Communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations. New Orleans Police Det. Winston Harbin became a minor Internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during Mardi Gras. Besides just being fun, Harbin's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing. Fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism, unequal treatment, bias, subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity. It is times like now, when that anger and resentment are boiling, that we address it. With the right approach, we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from \"HandsUpDon'tShoot\" to \"HandsTogetherInTrust.\"", "answer": ["Latest Ferguson shootings push strained race relations to breaking point .\nDonna Brazile: Relationship between police forces and minority communities must improve ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Dili, East Timor (CNN)Stacey Addison, who says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine, is headed home. Addison boarded a plane Tuesday on the first leg of her journey back to Oregon. \"I am thrilled to report that Dr. Stacey Addison has gotten her passport back, and is now on a plane returning home here to Oregon,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) said. \"This is terrific news for Stacey, for her family, and for all the Oregonians who have followed Stacey's story and helped support her from afar,\" Merkley said in a statement. Addison, 41, was detained in September in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. She was released in December but she still couldn't leave because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned. Former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, hosted her temporarily at his home. Addison's arrest in September was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world. She said she had been traveling solo since January 2013, having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe. On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili. On the way, a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a DHL office, her mother, Bernadette Kero of Oregon, has told CNN. After the man picked up the package, police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants, according to Kero. The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said. She initially was held for four nights, and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he didn't know her, Kero said. In late October, during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport, a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili. Paul Remedios, a lawyer representing Addison, said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest, and that the reason for the warrant was unclear. Kero told CNN in November that the case was a \"nightmare.\" Journalist Wayne Lovell in Dili and CNN's Greg Morrison from Atlanta.

{"question": "(CNN)Is Philae still alive? The answer to this particular cosmic cliff-hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year. The tiny space probe bounced across the surface of Comet 67P before touching down away from its intended landing zone. It returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there wasn't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since November. In the months since, mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place. But now the comet-chasing mother ship Rosetta -- in orbit around 67P -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark. Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the Sun, believe that if enough sunlight falls on Philae's solar panels it could revive. As the comet gets closer to the Sun and more light illuminates the lander, the chances improve. Lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself, nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two-way communication with the orbiter. Modern energy-saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it doesn't need much to re-establish contact. On Tuesday, @ESA_Rosetta tweeted: \"Excited! I have some opportunities to listen for @philae2014 to find out if he's awake!\" Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter . On the Rosetta mission blog, lander project manager Stephan Ulamec says: \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" The mission website adds that Philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with Rosetta. It says Rosetta will transmit to Philae between March 12 and March 20, listening for a response. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. However, the mishap could prove to be a happy accident. O'Rourke explained that as the comet nears the Sun, Philae's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics. In that position it most likely would have died by now. From lander pictures, mission controllers think Philae, which is about the size of a washing machine, is tucked up underneath a cliff face, affording it some shade. Beginning Thursday, mission controllers will send what O'Rourke described as \"blind commands\" to Philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it can't respond. Philae will be told to save power for the transmitter. O'Rourke admits that it's a \"long shot\" but the team will try again in April if this attempt fails. If Philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the Sun in August. \"I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point,\" said O'Rourke. Even if Philae never wakes up, all is not lost. The mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface, though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed. And the Rosetta mission is already changing perceptions of comets. O'Rourke says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being \"an icy dirtball.\" He described discoveries of dust and large \"boulders\" circling the comet after they were blown off by the Sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole. \"The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery,\" he said. Scientists have already applauded the mission's success to date. \"The Rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together,\" cosmochemist Denton S. Ebel told CNN in November. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission .

'He didn't have to go, he went for a lifestyle change to Canada but he still has that appetite to come back and play for Sunderland, in a relegation battle.

{"question": "(CNN)Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist terror group, has pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to an audio message purported to be from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. In the audio, which was posted online Saturday, the speaker says Boko Haram is announcing its \"allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims, Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi,\" which is another name for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the message. But Jacob Zenn, an expert on the terror group and is with the Jamestown Foundation, said the recording appeared to be authentic. He said that while other messages have been faked, the speaker in this one is Shekau. \"Boko Haram joining the ISIS fold makes sense to both groups,\" he said from Abuja, Nigeria. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands into (French-speaking) West Africa. It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Zenn said the allegiance will be official when an ISIS leader such as spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani issues a statement. Boko Haram has had two main factions -- one led by Shekau and the other comprising former members of  Ansaru, a Boko Haram offshoot. Ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the Nigerian wing of AQIM (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). After the French-led intervention in Mali in 2013, a significant number of Ansaru members re-integrated with Shekau, Zenn told CNN. The prerequisite for Boko Haram joining ISIS coalition was a coming together of two factions. ISIS connected with former Ansaru fighters within Boko Haram and pressed them to further unify the group's ranks. The result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions. That involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al Qaeda-like Ansaru and the ultra extreme \"takfiri\"-like Shekau. The pledge follows a period during which Shekau's faction had been mimicking ISIS, including praising al-Baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos. Zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from ISIS, apart from a few references to Nigerian jihadis in recent issues of the English-language Dabiq magazine. It appears that a month ago ISIS set up a Twitter account on which Saturday's message was linked, Zenn said. The Twitter handle was mutually promoted by Boko Haram and ISIS. In July, Shekau voiced support for ISIS, and declared a overtaken town in northeast Nigeria to be part of an Islamic caliphate. But he also said he was praying for al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. U.S. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along. The CIA's analysis has been that Boko Haram is very African and rooted in that region's Islamic practices, even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.  And ISIS's Arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks, not unlike the society they come from. ISIS leaders view Shekau as inferior, partly for racist reasons, the CIA indicated at a briefing for reporters. Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard.

'He is at a complete loss to try to understand any of it - he's trying to put the picture together now on not a lot of information at all to be honest - he is learning as much as anyone else is learning in the public forum,' Usher told Daily Mail Australia. John finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life. Jake's father shared pictures and cards with the programme, showing a Happy Father's Day cars with the words 'I Love You' written inside . Jake's father admitted to 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher (pictured right) that you didn't have to dig very far to realise that the 18-year-old was a very troubled soul . 'He can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan B which was to commit a major act of terror in Melbourne and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of Australia,' Usher said. As the youngest of six children, Jake had an atheist upbringing . 'That atrocity John can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who Jake was because he wasn't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble.' When Usher suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues, John agreed saying: 'yes they were and I'm so sorry I didn't do anything about it.' 'He said he was at times very difficult emotionally - even as a little boy,' Usher said. 'He also said \"I'm sorry I wish i could have done more to understand my son and stop him\" and he's finding it very hard to grieve because he's feeling so much guilt,' Usher said. ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it . To add to Jake's complexities, his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier. His father described his son as an 'extremely shy' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings. He said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son's bullying. 'I wish I could understand more of what went on,' he told Usher. But John also feels that his son was brainwashed and believes that he was a 'soft target for' the Islamic recruiters. Bilardi (pictured, left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends, and  wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (pictured right) Jake Bilardi's father feels a deep regret that he didn't address his son's issues when he was a child . His former fellow pupils also described Jake as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets and spoke seriously all of time about Middle Eastern politics. Although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to Muslim there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with Islamic State recruiters. Jake organised to get a passport and told his family he wanted to work at a charity in Uganda. 'He went online from writing about his love of soccer and wanting to buy a dog to children allowed to join the jihad and I cant wait for my pilgrimage to Mecca in December,' Usher said. The last time John ever saw his son was when he asked for his birth certificate in order to get a passport and said he seemed uncharacteristically 'upbeat'. 'He said he was articulate and clear and seemed happy and in fact in the last communications he seemed very content and he said to his dad \"I feel comfort being a Muslim and I feel comfort in Islam\", Usher said. 'John was optimistic that his son was on a good path that after the divorce and feeling alienated he thought that his son had found some happiness and peace.' However, these feelings were short-lived as John had a growing concern for his son's welfare by the last time he ever heard from Jake again in the form of a Facebook message when was in the Middle East. Footage of Jake being bullied at school - his former school mates described him as as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets . The last time his father saw Jake he was uncharacteristically 'upbeat' 'The message was pretty veiled other than to say that he was in the region and had some intent,' Usher said. John was understandably panicked but couldn't find a lot of places to turn to get help and was at a great loss at what to do. 'In fact even at that point, there was still some disbelieving that maybe this was just some great romantic notion of Jake's and he was off some ridiculous journey,' Usher said. 'Then he couldn't contact him and had no further communication from him and John learned of his son's death as it appeared in the media last week.' John send a warning out to all parents to be more aware about who their children are interacting with online. John was optimistic that his son was on a good path and had finally found happiness and peace . Jake's father warns all parents to take note of who their children are interacting with online . 'It's going on, it's happening, it's real it's not just from a Muslim background, it's anybody they can find, any soft target they will aim, human life means nothing to them,' John told Usher. 'I could tell he was brainwashed but they are such a powerful influence.' His father never wants to hear again the words that his son will be forever known as -  'Jihadi Jake'  but instead hold onto the memory of his beloved son. 'He's trying to preserve a little bit of who the Jake was that he knew and loved - the kid who loved soccer, the kid who used to run around in the backyard and play in the park with his dad . 'He said that's the Jake I need to remember - Jihadi Jake I don't even want to hear that name because I don't even know who that person is and that's not my son.'

{"question": "Researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes. They say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome, a word used to describe the different realms of life on Earth. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, researchers say. A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants. It found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa. Another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders . An examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. A review paper published March 19 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, for example, from the pest management field, or public health perspectives on microbes. The paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment, which included evolutionary, microbial and plant biologists, entomologists, architects, scientists who study better building design, and others. 'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin of Cornell, the paper's first author. 'But given the number of species found indoors, it is likely there's a lot more going on that we don't know about.' A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders; and an examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. 'I've been noticing more species inside my house since I went to this working group,' Martin said, referring to the 2013 workshop. Co-author Robert Dunn, of North Carolina State University, discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house. 'The radical diversity in abiotic environments, such as in water heaters, freezers and on kitchen counters, is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors,' said Martin. The paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today's indoor environments most closely resemble caves. The emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution, as the development of human-built environments has been recent. Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches: Researchers called for more research into pests, saying the home was an untapped resource. Close up of a bedbug on skin.'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin, the paper's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources. Researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution -  such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species. They also hope to compare species in Alaska, for example, with species in Texas; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors; which indoor species are healthful to have; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions. 'We are interested in reframing the dialogue away from what gross or dangerous pests live in houses to what biodiversity exists in houses,' Martin said.", "answer": ["Researchers say homes are a hotbed of undiscovered species .\nStudy of 40 North Carolina homes   found 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa .\n11 houses in California revealed a great variety of fungus among us ."], "label": "SUM"}
{"question": "Half of the terror attacks carried out or plotted in Britain involve members of just one extremist network, a new report reveals. Al-Muhajiroun, a banned organisation once fronted by hate preacher Anjem Choudary, has been linked to a series of atrocities and plots dating back to 1997. A new book by terrorism expert Raffaello Pantucci has now found that since its formation in the 1980s, the group has been central to Islamic extremism in the UK. More than 20 terror attacks plotted or carried out in the UK - including the 7/7 bombings which killed 52 people - have been linked to extremist network al-Muhajiroun in a new report . It is thought the first known violence directly linked to the group took place in 1997, when a member of the organisation attacked a police officer. At least one of the bombers who carried out London's 7/7 bombings had met a key supporter of al-Muhajiroun, Omar Khyam, before the attacks which killed 52 people on underground trains and a bus in 2005. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby in a street in Woolwich, south-east London in 2013, had both attended events organised by the group. Despite having been banned in 2005, the group has morphed to take on a series of other names, and its influence continues to be felt, with Brustholm Ziamani, who was sentenced last week for plotting an attack inspired by that on Lee Rigby, also having been inspired by al-Muhajiroun. Research shows that out of 51 attacks and plots carried out or foiled in Britain, al-Muhajiroun had influence in at least 23. Mr Pantucci, who studies extremism for defence forum The Royal United Services Institute, said the group sold its followers a radical interpretation of Islam which often inspired them to  commit violence. He told MailOnline: 'It is an oversimplification just to write them off as outcasts or losers, some of them have been involved in quite serious gang activity or crime in the past and end up finding this as a kind of redemption for their activity. 'You also have to remember that some of the top figures are quite charismatic people who are good at drawing people in and given them these very aggressive ideas.' Hate preacher Anjem Choudary (left) was once a leader of the group before it was banned. Supporter Omar Khyam (right) met up with at least one of the London bombers before they carried out the 2005 attack . Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed (left), pictured with radical cleric Abu Hamzu (right) Mr Pantucci said that the group's influence had been underestimated in the past and hoped his book - whose title We Love Death As You Love Life is taken from quotation by one of the 7/7 bombers - would encourage politicians to crack down on the organisation and its spin-offs. He added: 'These people are very good at being in the periphery and the background without ever having their hands on the device or being directly implicated in plots, which would see them given heavier sentences. 'I think constant disruption of the group is not a bad thing. By proscribing these groups you force them to change their name, their website, which inhibits them, also by arresting them on more minor charges you take them off the streets for a time.' Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed, a Syria-born Islamic extremist who lived in Britain from 1986 until he was banned from returning in 2005 after going to Lebanon. Anjem Choudary, who remains in Britain, later became the public face of the organisation, which re-emerged as groups called Islam4UK and Need4Khalafah after it was banned.

Then-al- Muhajiroun leader Bakri Mohammed says its possible he was 'one of their number'. 2002: US journalist was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan. London-born Omar Saeed, a member of al- Muhajiroun, is later convicted over the plot and remains in prison in Pakistan. 2004: Five men, four of whom are thought to have been members of al-Muhajiroun, were caught by police while plotting to build a huge fertiliser bomb, which they dicussed setting off in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent or the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London.

{"question": "An ex-CFO and Chick-fil-A protestor who lost his job after posting a video rant against one of the chain's employees  has since lost his home and lives on food stamps. Adam Mark Smith, 37, who worked for an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, was shamed after the 2012 YouTube video was posted showing him berating employee Rachel Elizabeth. The video which expressed his disdain over the firm's anti-gay marriage stance went viral, and left him unemployed and forced to lose his home. Nearly three years later, the married father of four is still searching for a job and his family previously had to give away possessions before he was hired and fired again, according to ABC. Scroll down for video . Adam Smith was the former CFO of an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, before he was fired after posting a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee for the fast-food chain's anti-gay marriage stance . Three years later from the viral video that shook his life from riches to rags, the married father of four is still searching for a job (Smith above with his family) At the time he was working as CFO for Vante, Smith was earning $200,000 annually and had more than $1million in stock options, but he said it was all taken from him when he was fired. His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV. But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later. 'I felt like, \"yeah, I got it. I am back'',' he said. However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video. In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there . Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted . As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth. While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water: Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity. The controversy surrounding one of America's biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A's COO Dan T. Cathy. Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports. In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage. When asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded 'Well, guilty as charged’. He also stated that Chick-fil-A is runs on 'traditional Christian values' and is 'very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit'. In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country. The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to 'true wealth'. In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again. In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm's support for traditional Christian marriage. Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange. He said: 'I don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.' Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: 'I'm staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don't belong in the workplace.' As he drives off he tells the worker: 'I'm a nice guy by the way, and I'm totally heterosexual. Just can't stand the hate. It's gotta stop guys, stand up.' Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked. Smith told 20/20: 'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, 'Adam, what did you do?', she said. 'The voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats.'' After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc. They released a statement saying: 'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions. In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace . Wanda Flory, of Swanton, Ohio, center, watches with Terry, (left), and her husband Richard, (center right), as Thea Grabiec, (right), kisses Sarah Shovan during the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day . Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled . 'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.' After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth. 'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,' said Smith in the video. 'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure. 'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.' Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks 'Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day' and lost his cool. Shown Smith's apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it. She said: 'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape.

{"question": "The grieving family of a Turkish prosecutor who died after being shot in the head and chest during courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral today. Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Istanbul to pay their respects to Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died yesterday after the six-hour stand-off. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Mr Kiraz died in hospital after the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grive over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group were holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Respect: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-Left. Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. Standing guard: Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. Moving in: Armed police massed outside the Istanbul courthouse . Rushed to safety: Court officials were seen being escorted to safety by armed police . Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister .

{"question": "Tributes are pouring in for Lil' Chris, the star of Channel 4 Rock School fame, who has been found dead at the age of 24. The actor, singer and TV personality, whose real name is Chris Hardman, died on Monday in his home town of Lowestoft. The news comes just months before the young star was preparing to launch a pop comeback. Police have said his death is not being treated as suspicious. McBusted's Harry Judd and Strictly Come Dancing's Caroline Flack are among the celebrities who have paid tribute to the 'lovely, young lad'. Scroll down for video . Lil Chris, whose name is Chris Hardman, who made his name on Channel 4's Rock School, has died aged 24 . Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who propelled Chris to fame on Rock School after making him the lead singer of a student band, also tweeted: 'Sad to report Lil Chris from the Gene Simmons Rock School TV show, has passed on. He was loved. RIP, Lil Chris.' He later told Mirror Online: 'Lil Chris was a kind, little soul. I will greatly miss his smile and his spirit. I knew there was something special about him as soon as I met him.' After becoming the show's breakout star, Chris was offered a solo deal, going on to release his best-known hit, Checkin' It Out, in 2006. The song, later used in Asda's George clothing campaigns, debuted at number 13 in the UK Single Chart, and shot to Number 3 the following week. The news of his death comes four months before he was due to release a comeback album, having not released one since 2008's What's It All About. In December he wrote on Twitter: 'I'm planning to come back again! Hopefully this time for a little longer! Keep sticking around for updates. (sic)' But earlier this month, the musician told his followers that he was considering giving up his career as a singer. He wrote: 'Thinking about quitting music forever...there has to come a time eventually when I have to face reality. I'm just not good enough. (sic)' The star has previously been vocal about suffering with depression, mentioning the illness in two separate tweets last year. He tweeted: 'I hope to one day create a way out of depression that doesn't mean taking your own life. The Cure.' Tragic: Police have said that the young singer's death is not being treated as suspicious . Chris had previously been vocal about suffering with depression, posting this tweet in April last year . And in another message he wrote: 'Depression really sucks. Learning how to notice it can save lives and your own feelings at times. Take time to understand it, for everybody.' His last tweet, on Wednesday March 18, read: 'Good morning everybody! Lovely day! Love you all x.' Today, Chris's Loserville director, Elliot Davis, told WhatsOnStage that his early fame could have triggered the illness. 'He was a super talented guy, so naturally gifted. He just had something that the nation saw and it catapulted him to early fame, which perhaps caused problems,' he said. Allan Dodgeon, who managed Chris for a year from 2013, added that he was in 'complete shock'. He said: 'He was an outstanding talent and it was a pleasure to work with him. Our thoughts are with his friends and family.' The singer, pictured left in concert in 2007 at the Corn Exchange, Cambridge and right at the Trafford Centre, Manchester, in 2006 . Chris went on to host his own talk show, Everybody Loves Lil' Chris on Channel 4, and interviewed several famous faces . Chris first appeared on the second series of reality TV show Rock School when he was 15. In the show, which was filmed at Kirkley High School in Lowestoft, Gene Simmons prepared classically trained young students to be rock stars. Chris was selected as the frontman of the band Hoax UK. Later, in 2006, the young singer released his debut album after signing a deal with RCA, triggering a huge fun base, mainly of teenager girls. He then went on to host his own talk show, Everybody Loves Lil' Chris on Channel 4, on which he interviewed a number of celebrities and hosted live music performances. The show was also made up of 'challenges' which the guests carried out on screen. Chris first found fame on the reality TV show Rock School, aged 15, where Gene Simmons prepared classically trained young students to be rock stars . Last selfie: Chris posted a picture to Twitter on March 11 asking fans whether he should cut his hair . In 2012, Chris played Francis Weir in Loserville, which was premiered in Leeds and later moved to the Garrick Theatre in London's West End. Lil Chris' last single was titled Christmas Number One, and was released in December 2013. Earlier today, the singer's mother Karen Hardman posted a number of photos of her late son on Facebook to confirm the news. His close friend Lloyd Wilkinson, with whom he once recorded a single, paid his respects on Facebook: 'I can not believe I'm doing this and I'm completely devastated. Rest in peace brother bear. Love you mate. Chris Hardman Aka Lil' Chris.' After news of his death emerged, tributes flooded in for the young singer from fellow celebrities.

The X Factor's Luke Friend said his childhood 'wouldn't be the same without this great man' Chris performed as a support act for McFly in 2007 on their Up Close and Personal tour across the country for 24 dates. The band's drummer Harry Judd wrote: 'Shocked and saddened to hear the news about Lil' Chris.

{"question": "A man who survived a suicide leap from the Golden Gate Bridge has told in detail how he was saved by a sea lion which kept him afloat until the coastguard arrived. Kevin Hines is now a global speaker on mental health issues and shared his remarkable story at a suicide prevention conference in New South Wales, Australia. Aged just 21, he was suffering from bipolar disorder and psychosis when he jumped from the San Francisco landmark on a chilly September day in 2000. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Mental health campaigner Kevin Hines told a conference yesterday how he survived a suicide attempt nearly 15 years ago - because a sea lion circled under him and kept him afloat until help arrived . Although he lived, Mr Hines almost lost his ability to walk and was saved only by 14 hours of surgery on his back. But immediately after the four-second fall there was another, more incredible miracle. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 'I guess you would call it a mammal began swimming beneath me and I'm thinking, \"Oh man, a shark is about to devour me\". 'I was on a show for suicide prevention and I mentioned that I thought there was this shark on this show and a man wrote into the show and he said, \"Kevin, I'm so very glad you're alive, I was less than two feet away from you when you jumped\". 'He said: \"It haunted me until this day; it was no shark, it was a sea lion and the people above looking down believed it to be keeping you afloat until the coast guard brought a ride behind you.\"' Landmark: By a stroke of luck, a witness saw Mr Hines jump from the vast bridge and alerted the coastguard . Conference: Mr Hines spoke at the New South Wales Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney, Australia. The force attended nearly 50,000 mental health incidents last year . With temperatures in the bay's waters as low as 12C, Mr Hines could have died of hypothermia had a witness not seen him jump and raised the alarm. Mr Hines said he never intended to tell his story because he was 'embarrassed', but changed his mind after a life-affirming talk to 120 students, many of whom had suicidal thoughts. Now he has written a book about his experience, Cracked, Not Broken, and appears at conferences all over the world. With medication and professional help he has managed to reduce his symptoms, including the voices in his head which told him to jump on that day 14 and a half years ago. 'The message is very very simple,' he told ABC. 'You don't have to die this way.' Mr Hines says he is one of just 34 survivors of falls from the Golden Gate Bridge, which rises high above the San Francisco Bay, and the only one to become a mental health campaigner. Population: Sea lions basking on piers in San Francisco. Mr Hines said the theory was perfectly plausible . He spoke yesterday as part of the NSW Police Force Mental Health Intervention Team conference in Sydney. The force attended almost 50,000 mental health incidents in 2014 alone, and set up to conference to discuss how the often-misunderstood issue should be tackled. Mr Hines had talked about being saved by a sea lion before, including in a 2013 blog post. 'There are a large number of reporters and speculators who have claimed it was really a seal, and even those who have claimed that there was nothing but me in that water,' he wrote. 'However, I know that it was a sea lion and it is not a statistic anomaly. Marine animals (dolphins, sea lions) and other creatures have helped save humans and other animals from dangerous situations all over the world. 'I say believe it or don’t, that’s completely up to you. I know the truth, and in this case and that is all that matters.'

{"question": "The Taliban have reportedly captured an former US military base in the western Afghan province of Farah. The news was released through a 16 minute video, in which dozens of Taliban fighters are shown being driven into the fortified base. The white flag of the Taliban is also shown being unfurled by one of the militants whilst another scene shows one of the group's leaders making a lengthy speech in Pashto. The white flags of the Taliban can be seen being unfurled over the buildings as the fighters swarm into the former US military base. A senior Taliban leader is shown making a speech, declaring that the military base had been liberated by the Taliban. The video shows footage of  well-built fortitications of the former US base, once used to tackle the local trade in heroin in Farah province. The Taliban's exaggerated report ignores the fact that the base had not been used by NATO forces for over a year. American troops have not been operating from Bakwa base since March 2013. Multiple convoys of white estate cars are shown being driven into the compound, parking inside the fort walls. Fighters dressed in traditional Afghan dress and armed with machine guns can be seen getting out of the cars and gathering outside Bakwa district's headquarters building. Multiple convoys of white estate cars are shown being driven into the compound, parking inside the fort walls. The low quality footage was recently released in Pashto by al-Emarah media, the Taliban's official multimedia branch.

{"question": "The White House is reportedly considering a new power play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would paint Benjamin Netanyahu into a corner just days after his stunning come-from-behind victory in his country's hotly contested elections. In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu vowed in an historic U-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. But now President Barack Obama is contemplating using the United Nations as a trump card to force the issue. Under a plan outlined by Foreign Policy magazine, the U.S. State Department would ease away from decades of opposition to a Security Council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The White House cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on Thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic, saying only that it would 'evaluate what our path is forward' is in light of Netanyahu's comments. NOT SO FAST ... The White House is considering a Netanyahu smackdown in the form on United Nations leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with Palestinians . WATCHING AND WAITING: State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US is evaluating its options – leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a UN two-state solution pushed on Israel . The U.S. and Israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship. A former top-level Obama campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with Netanyahu's political opposition – even as the president refused to meet with Netanyahu this month, saying he didn't want to influence the election's outcome. The Obama administration hoped to see Netanyahu's left-wing rival, Isaac Herzog, prevail on Tuesday. Diplomats at the UN privately learned in the run-up to Election Day that the U.S. would not press the UN Security Council on peace talks if Herzog were to win, since he would likely have carried the ball on his own. But with Netanyahu poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties opposed to a Palestinian state, all bets are off. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that 'we’re currently evaluating our approach. We’re not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action.' The chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue reiterated the administration's position on Thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the United States' part. He also refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's victory, stating that, obviously, the president was 'aware' of it when asked by a reporter if Obama was 'disappointed' with the election results. Complicating the situation, the Palestinian Authority says it might take grievances against Israel, stemming from last year's brief Gaza war, to the International Criminal Court. The Palestine Liberation Organization’s top diplomat in the United States explained to Foreign Policy that the PA could formally accuse Israel of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks. Israel has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians, but insists militants from the Hamas terror group took shelter where collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire. Turning to the ICC for redress would prove costly for Palestinians, however. The United States provides about $500 million in annual aid to the PA, and $400 million of that is drawn from an Economic Support Fund that members of Congress from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off. The U.S. has paid out approximately $5 billion in aid money to the Palestinian Authority since the 1990s, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service – representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community. But at the end of January an astonishing 75 out of 100 U.S. senators signed a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry warning that any Palestinian action against Israel in the ICC would be met by a budget axe. The 2015 budget appropriations bill, signed by Obama, explicitly prohibited funding for the PA if it were to initiate – or even actively support – an ICC probe related to war crimes accusations against Israel. BIG CHILL: President Barack Obama has had the frostiest relationship with Israel of any US leader since the 1970s . The senators warned Kerry that Abbas was illegally challenging 'Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory.' PA President Mahmoud Abbas officially joined the ICC late last year. In the days following the seating of the new Congress in January – long before Netanyahu notched his surprising re-election win – the State Department seemed to lean toward supporting the Senate. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters then that action in the ICC could have unspecified 'implications' for future U.S.-Palestinian aid. 'Congress has a great deal of power in that regard,' she said. But administration officials are now leaning toward using the United Nations to force Netanyahu into a tricky spot. 'We are signaling that if the Israeli government’s position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state, we’re going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward,' a U.S. official told Politico. And Jeremy Ben-Ami, who leads the pro-Israel but left-wing group J Street, told the paper that he expects the Obama administration to look very closely at the possibility of either joining, or at least not blocking an internationally backed move at the UN to restate the parameters for ending the [Arab-Israeli] conflict.' White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough's remarks to the group on Monday at its national conference in Washington, D.C. could shed further light on the administration's position. The Israeli election, and the Obama administration's reactions, come against the backdrop of U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear ambitions and Netanyahu's forceful objections that a nuke in Tehran would be an existential threat to Israel. Kerry, America's top diplomat, phoned Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory, but did so from Switzerland where he was meeting with his Iranian counterpart. President Obama called the Israeli leader Thursday afternoon, the White House said.", "answer": ["Obama may end US opposition to a UN Security Council resolution designed to force Israel into a two-state solution with Palestinians .\nWhite House is upset that Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected, especially on the U-turn promise that he wouldn't  agree to a Palestinian state .\nPalestinian Authority threatened to file war crimes charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court, related to rocket attacks last summer .\nUS Congress would cut $400 million in annual aid to the PA is it followed through .\nObama's spokesman refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's reelection on Thursday .\nHe would only say that the Israeli PM's comments on Palestine had lead the president and his advisers to 'evaluate what our path is forward'"], "label": "SUM"}

It is the second consecutive grand prix where the McLaren have been knocked out in the first phase of qualifying, but Alonso, back in the cockpit after he missed the season opener in Melbourne through injury, moved to praise the team’s improvement. Fernando Alonso posted a picture with Ron Dennis (right) and Eric Boullier (second left) on Saturday evening . Fernando Alonso failed to make it out of Q1 and will start from 18th position in Sunday's Malaysian GP . Alonso, back at the wheel of a F1 car, hailed McLaren's progress since the opening race of the season . ‘I'd say the progress we've made since Australia has been fantastic,', said Alonso. ‘We're much closer to the cars in front now but we're still under-performing and we still need to improve.' Alonso then posted a picture on Twitter of him dining out with Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, and team principal Eric Boullier. The snap comes after Alonso contradicted McLaren's version of events surrounding the mysterious testing crash which ruled him out of the race in Melbourne. ‘Our form today wasn't unexpected but I think our performance so far this weekend has maybe been better than I'd have anticipated before arriving here in Malaysia,' Alonso added. ‘However, the steps we're taking with the car show a lot of progress, so I'm optimistic that I won't be qualifying in Q1 for that much longer. ‘This isn't an ideal position from which to start the race, but I'm fully aware that McLaren-Honda is a long-term project.

I'd like to think we could get closer to some of the cars in front tomorrow; that'll be something to look forward to. ‘There are a lot of positives to take from this weekend: we've made a big step forwards in terms of pace.

{"question": "The pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending Steven Gerrard have been a joke. Unfortunately for arguably Liverpool’s greatest-ever player, he proved on Sunday that Brendan Rodgers has made the correct decision to cut him loose from Anfield at the end of this season. I’d be surprised if Gerrard makes the Liverpool starting line-up again, and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye. Why should Rodgers trust Gerrard again this season? Steven Gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for Liverpool at Anfield . Gerrard stamped on Ander Herrera's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half . Herrera gestures and points at Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge . This is an experienced professional, a captain, a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at Liverpool Football Club down. He also failed to apologise to Ander Herrera in his brief post-match interview, which showed a lack of class. Some said Gerrard was frustrated because he wasn’t in the starting line-up. That might be true, but it doesn’t excuse a violent stamp on an opponent’s ankle. Others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion. After all his years in the game, with all his knowledge of this fixture, he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion – and that’s to make good, clean tackles, play well and get the job done. This was Liverpool’s biggest game of the season, against fierce rivals, it’s a game they’re losing when he comes on the pitch and it’s a game they need to win. Liverpool captain Gerrard looks baffled after seeing referee Martin Atkinson brandish a red card . Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against Man United in a Liverpool shirt . If Wayne Rooney had done it, the reaction would be far worse. There would be calls to strip him of the England captaincy. If it had been Joey Barton, the reaction would have hit fever pitch. Had it been a Chelsea player – well, the internet and the FA would have been in meltdown. There would have been talk of points deductions probably. But because it was Gerrard, the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently, according to the apologists, Rodgers made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line-up. Gerrard (centre) walks past  Brendan Rodgers (left) as Emre Can (right) listens to instructions from his boss . Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge . Last season’s slip against Chelsea was accidental, the stamp on Sunday was calculated: at best it was Gerrard being a careless hot-head desperate to make a mark. At worst, it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club. Gerrard was the main man responsible for one of Liverpool’s most glorious nights back in 2005 in Istanbul. Nobody can ever take that away from him. Ten years on, there’s a good chance that Gerrard’s last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing Manchester United a passage back into the Champions League – at Liverpool’s expense. Gerrard’s legacy is shattered. It’s a sad and sorry way to go, but he only has himself to blame.

He warned that any photographer taking unflattering pictures would lose their accreditation. 'We have to absolutely protect that because it's at the core of what we are, and we have a responsibility to our customers to project the correct image,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'We have talked about trying to monitor those photographers, so if we see any element clearly looking for a negative shot and we can identify that, we will take their accreditation off them and we'll kick them off the site.

{"question": "(CNN)For those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new, more inspiring politics, this past week has been deeply discouraging. In two key moments, leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the Bourbons of France, who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past. The first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by Republican senators to the Iranian regime. The second, and perhaps more important politically telling moment, was Hillary Clinton's handling of her emails. The two cases are oddly related. In both instances, the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse. In both cases, the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency. Both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today's ugly politics. Republicans in Congress have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with Iran enter the home stretch. They, like many others -- including a sizable number of Democrats, the current Israeli government, and friendly Arab nations -- fear the Obama administration will cut a weak, leaky deal that will allow Iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons. Just as importantly, Republicans believe, with cause, that as he negotiates, President Barack Obama has tried to sideline Congress in general and them in particular. Who can blame them for arguing that if the President insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by Congress -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions? Their basic concerns were not unreasonable. Thus, if they had sent exactly the same letter to the President, they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and statecraft. Instead, they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of Iran, leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the President. We have had renegade members of Congress try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember Sen. Jesse Helms? -- but never 47 members of the United States Senate tossing a hand grenade into delicate, life-or-death negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the United States. Ayatollah Khamenei made clear this week that he may use the Republican letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal. Where do we go then? Will talks collapse? Will an Iranian rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race, starting in Saudi Arabia, which is already taking preliminary steps? Will the United States then be compelled to use military force against Iran? Who knows for sure? What we do know is that Iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the Republican nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard, unyielding line. One can just imagine a number of GOP candidates pledging that if elected, they will abolish Obamacare on Day 1 and an Iranian agreement on Day 2. This is hardly a way to restore steady, bipartisan foreign policies, as we so badly need. And why have Republicans forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last GOP president was too hard line and reckless? On the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state. As one who spent a year and a half at the Clinton White House and State Department, I could see first hand how they -- more than any president since Nixon -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize. It is small wonder that both Clintons still have scar tissue. Hillary Clinton's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system. No, they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the State Department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt, air-tight basis. That did not break laws. But it did run afoul of government procedures and, when revealed, naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding. In her press conference, she did accomplish her obvious mission: she began cutting legs off the story. In essence, she said one half of her emails (the official ones) are now safely with the State Department and, at her request, will gradually be made public. The other half (who knows what's in there?) have been deleted and she is keeping the server. In effect, she says, they are gone ... and gone forever, beyond Congressional subpoena, FOIA requests, and even hackers. What fresh revelations can the press now pursue? Not many. And how can Republicans browbeat her in hearings without looking like bullies? Hard to do. In short, the story may soon die. You just have to trust me, she says. Clever. But the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral, trusted party like Lee Hamilton to review all the emails, she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price: she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules. Loyal Democrats will continue to invest their faith in her, but for many others, the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease. And polarization deepens. She was always going to face a rough campaign, but now she will begin with clouds already gathering. More to the point, they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader. Around the world, many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment. And she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation: 22.9 million were created in the eight Clinton years, more than in any other presidency since World War II (Reagan was second at 16.1 million; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six Obama years.). In short, she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are American politics. Bill Clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right. But candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday. After this last week, they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian Barbara Tuchman published some 30 years ago: \"The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.\" There she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path, stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck. Tuchman calls their refusal to learn from experience \"wooden-headedness\". We have seen too much wooden-headedness these past days.", "answer": ["David Gergen: Iran almost certain to become big issue in 2016 campaign .\nClinton's mistakes did not start with creating email protection system, he says ."], "label": "SUM"}
