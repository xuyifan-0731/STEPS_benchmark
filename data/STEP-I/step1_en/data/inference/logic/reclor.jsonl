{"question": "Government department head: We already have a code of ethics that companies doing business with the department are urged to abide by. The fact that virtually all of the companies have agreed to abide by it indicates that it is successful. Ttherefore, neither stronger ethics regulations nor enforcement mechanisms are necessary to ensure ethical behavior by companies doing business with the department.

{"question": "Head injury is the most serious type of injury sustained in motorcycle accidents. The average cost to taxpayers for medical care for nonhelmeted motorcycle-accident victims is twice that for their helmeted counterparts. Jurisdictions that have enacted motorcycle-helmet laws have reduced the incidence and severity of accident-related head injuries, thereby reducing the cost to taxpayers. Ttherefore, to achieve similar cost reductions, other jurisdictions should enact motorcycle-helmet laws. For the same reason jurisdictions should also require helmets for horseback riders, since horseback-riding accidents are even more likely to cause serious head injury than motorcycle accidents are. Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the author's conclusion concerning helmets for horseback riders depends?", "choices": ["When deciding whether to enact helmet laws for motorcyclists and horseback riders, the jurisdiction's primary concern is the safety of its citizens.", "The medical costs associated with treating head injuries are higher than those for other types of injury.", "The higher rate of serious head injury suffered by victims of horseback-riding accidents is due to the difference in size between horses and motorcycles.", "Medical care for victims of horseback-riding accidents is a financial drain on tax funds."], "answer": "D", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Educational Theorist: Recent editorials have called for limits on the amount of homework assigned to children. They point out that free-time activities play an important role in childhood development and that large amounts of homework reduce children' s free time, hindering their development. But the average homework time for a ten year old, for example, is little more than 30 minutes per night. Clearly, ttherefore, there is no need to impose the limits these editorials are calling for. Which of the following is an assumption on which the educational theorist's argument relies?", "choices": ["In most schools, if not all, the homework assignments given are of a length that does not diverge widely from the average.", "The free-time activities that ten year olds engage in most are all approximately equally effective at fostering development", "Individual teachers are not the best judges of how much homework to assign the children they teach", "Free-time activities rarely teach children skills or information that they can use in their academic work."], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Recent trends in the clothing industry have suggested that more clothing is being produced more quickly and cheaply than in the past; styles can go from the runway to stores in as little as three weeks. While most experts have focused on minimizing the time this process takes, True Clothing has in fact made efforts to take longer to produce its clothing. Which of the following would, if true, most help to explain the strategy of True Clothing referred to above?", "choices": ["Some items of clothing can be worn in different ways to create different styles, depending on the individual consumers.", "The sales of well-made clothing, which takes longer to produce, are less likely to fluctuate in different market conditions.", "Companies with large market shares in the clothing industry tend to be less concerned with industrial trends.", "Clothing once produced only for adult consumers is increasingly being produced for teenagers."], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Concerned citizen: The mayor, an outspoken critic of the proposed restoration of city hall, is right when he notes that the building is outdated, but that the restoration would be expensive at a time when the budget is already tight. We cannot afford such a luxury item in this time of financial restraint, he says. However, I respectfully disagree. The building provides the last remaining link to the days of the city' s founding, and preserving a sense of municipal history is crucial to maintaining respect for our city government and its authority. So to the question, \"Can we really afford to? \"I can only respond, \"Can we afford not to? \" Which one of the following most accurately characterizes a flaw in the concerned citizen's argument?", "choices": ["The argument ambiguously uses the word \"afford. \"", "The argument is solely an emotional appeal to history.", "The argument inappropriately appeals to the authority of the mayor.", "The argument inappropriately relies on the emotional connotations of words such as \"outdated\" and \"luxury. \""], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Carol: The best choice for investment is real estate because the payout is huge. Even though the market can be a little unpredictable, it' s the quickest way to turn a sizable profit. Kenny: Real estate is way too risky and people get huge sums of money tied up into one house that sometimes they can' t sell or the value depreciates precipitously. It' s much wiser to invest in dependable things like utilities or bonds. Based on the text above, which of the following can be assumed about Carol and Kenny's investment strategies?", "choices": ["Kenny is willing to take risks only if the potential payout is huge.", "Kenny would invest in stocks before he would invest in real estate.", "Carol is very risk averse.", "Carol is more willing to take risks than Kenny."], "answer": "D", "label": "MUL"}

Miriam: A moral theory, like an overcoat, can be quite useful even if it is not useful in every possible situation. Being useful in a wide variety of common circumstances is all we need from a moral theory. Laurel's and Miriam's statements provide the most support for the claim that they disagree about whether", "choices": ["a moral theory's adequacy depends on its ability to provide guidance in extreme cases", "a moral theory developed in the light of extreme cases is unlikely to provide adequate guidance in more usual cases", "it is preferable to develop a moral theory that provides solutions to all the moral dilemmas that could arise", "people abandoned earlier moral theories when they encountered dilemmas that those theories did not adequately address"], "answer": "A", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "Political strategist: Clearly, attacking an opposing candidate on philosophical grounds is generally more effective than attacking the details of the opponent' s policy proposals. A philosophical attack links an opponent' s policy proposals to an overarching ideological scheme, thereby telling a story and providing context. This makes the attack emotionally compelling. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the political strategist' s argument?", "choices": ["The stories that people are most likely to remember are those that are emotionally compelling.", "Political attacks that tell a story are able to provide more context than those that do not.", "Voters are typically uninterested in the details of candidates' policy proposals.", "Political attacks that are emotionally compelling are generally more effective than those that are not."], "answer": "D", "label": "MUL"}

{"question": "Gartland has long been narrowly self-sufficient in both grain and meat. However, as per capita income in Gartland has risen toward the world average, per capita consumption of meat has also risen toward the world average, and it takes several pounds of grain to produce one pound of meat. Ttherefore, since per capita income continues to rise, whereas domestic grain production will not increase, Gartland will soon have to import either grain or meat or both. Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?", "choices": ["The population of Gartland has remained relatively constant during the country's years of growing prosperity.", "The per capita consumption of meat in Gartland is roughly the same across all income levels.", "In Gartland, neither meat nor grain is subject to government price controls.", "People in Gartland who increase their consumption of meat will not radically decrease their consumption of grain."], "answer": "D", "label": "MUL"}

Economic considerations should ideally not be dominant.", "The many fatal strokes and heart attacks resulting from untreated hypertension cause insignificant medical expenditures but large economic losses of other sorts.", "The net savings in medical resources achieved by some preventive health measures are smaller than the net losses attributable to certain other measures of this kind.", "The cost, per patient, of preventive treatment for hypertension would remain constant even if such treatment were instituted on a large scale."], "answer": "B", "label": "MUL"}
{"question": "John of Worcester, an English monk, recorded the sighting, on December 8, 1128, of two unusually large sunspots. Five days later a brilliant aurora borealis (northern lights) was observed in southern Korea. Sunspot activity is typically followed by the appearance of an aurora borealis, after a span of time that averages five days. Thus, the Korean sighting helps to confirm John of Worcester' s sighting. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?", "choices": ["Chinese sources recorded the sighting of sunspots more than 1000 years before John of Worcester did.", "An aurora borealis can sometimes occur even when there has been no significant sunspot activity in the previous week.", "Only heavy sunspot activity could have resulted in an aurora borealis viewable at a latitude as low as that of Korea.", "Because it is impossible to view sunspots with the naked eye under typical daylight conditions, the sighting recorded by John of Worcester would have taken place under unusual weather conditions such as fog or thin clouds."], "answer": "C", "label": "MUL"}
