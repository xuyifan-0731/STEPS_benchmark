{"background": "Although there is no formal process of selection, in larger groups, leaders are usually chosen formally through election or recruitment .\nAlthough leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades  of research have failed to produce evidence that there are any \"natural leaders\". It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; or rather, any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group.\nResearch suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \"get things done\". Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings  of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.\nInstrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit  attainment of the group's goals. Expressive leaders develop a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties and try to solve problems that threaten to divide the group. As the difference between these two roles suggests, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect.", "question": "In mentioning \"natural leaders\" in Line 4, the author is making the point that   _  .", "choices": ["few people qualify as \"natural leaders\"", "\"natural leaders\" share a similar set of characteristics", "there is no proof that \"natural leaders\" exist", "\"natural leaders\" are easily accepted by the members of a group"], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "Science Fiction\nThe science fiction type of entertainment is considered by most to be fathered by Jules Verne (A Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) and H. G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.\nWriting in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nOne of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as \"big brother\" and \"doublethink\". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian  government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication, setting a record that still stands.\nWhat helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation. The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story. For example, the beginning of space exploration was followed a few years later by the Star Trek television program and movie series. Advances in genetics  cause fantasies of the end of disease, horrors of eugenics , and thrillers where creatures disappearing long ago are brought back to life. The science fiction author's self-determined role is that of field glasses for humanity--searching the world of future possibilities upon the road which we are traveling.", "question": "According to the author, what is the role of science fiction in society?", "choices": ["A moral compass.", "A reference of technology.", "A record of science development.", "A consideration of possibilities."], "answer": 3, "label": "MUL"}

{"background": "Wilderness\n\"In wilderness  is the preservation of the world.\" This is a famous saying from a writer regarded as one of the fathers of environmentalism. The frequency with which it is borrowed mirrors a heated debate on environmental protection: whether to place wilderness at the heart of what is to be preserved.\nAs John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out, there is a strong appeal in images of the wild, the untouched; more than anything else, they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly. The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong, and the danger exploitation  brings to such landscapes  is real. Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need--the rainforests, for example, store carbon in vast quantities. To Mr.Sauven, these \"ecosystem services\" far outweigh the gains from exploitation.\nLee Lane, a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute, takes the opposing view. He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services, such as water conservation. But that is not, he argues, a reason to avoid all human presence, or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation. There are ever more people on the Earth, and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives, rather than merely struggle for survival. While the ways of using resources have improved, there is still a growing need for raw materials, and some wildernesses contain them in abundance. If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide, the argument goes, there is no further reason not to do so. Being untouched is not, in itself, a characteristic worth valuing above all others.\nI look forwards to seeing these views taken further, and to their being challenged by the other participants. One challenge that suggests itself to me is that both cases need to take on the question of spiritual value a little more directly.

{"background": "For most people, shopping is still a matter of wandering down the street or loading a cart in a shopping mall.Soon, that will change.Electronic commerce (trade) is growing fast and will soon bring people more choices.There will, however, be a cost: protecting the consumer from being cheated will be harder.Many governments therefore want to apply street regulations to the electronic world.But politicians would be wiser to see cyberspace as a basis for a new era of corporate self-regulation.\nConsumers in rich countries have grown used to the idea that the government takes responsibility for everything for the stability of the banks to the safety of the drugs or their rights to refund when goods are faulty.But governments cannot enforce national laws on businesses whose only presence is on the screen.Even in a country where a clear right to compensation exists, the on-line customer in Tokyo, say, can hardly go to New York to get a refund for a clothes purchase.\nOne answer is for government to cooperate more: to recognize each other's  rules.But that requires years of work and volumes of detailed rules.And plenty of countries have rules too fanciful for sober countries to accept.There is, however, another choice.Let the electronic businesses do the regulation themselves.They do, after all, have a self-interest in doing so.\nIn electronic commerce, a reputation for honest dealing will be a valuable competitive asset.Governments, too, may compete to be trusted.For instance, customers ordering medicines on-line may prefer to buy from the United States because they trust the rigorous screening of the Food and Drug Administration; or they may decide that the FDA's rules are too strict, and buy from Switzerland instead.\nCustomers will still need to use their judgment.But precisely because the technology is new, electronic shoppers are likely for a while to be a lot more cautious than customers of the normal sort.And the new technology will also make it easier for them to complain when a company lets them down.In this way, at least, the advent of cyberspace may argue for fewer consumer protection laws, not more.", "question": "If a customer buys something that does not meet his expectation, what is the advantage of dealing through electronic commerce over the present normal one?", "choices": ["It will be easier for him to return the goods he is not satisfied with.", "It will be easier for him to attain the refund from the seller.", "It will be easier for him to get his complaints heard by other consumers.", "It will be easier for him to complain about this to the government."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}
{"background": "Take a look at the label  on almost any bottle of milk and you may see the word PASTEURIZED. What does that mean? Let's find out by meeting Louis Pasteur.\nLouis Pasteur was born in 1822 in a little town in France. As he grew up, he loved to paint. He loved to look at the world around him. When he went to college in Paris, he showed interest in looking through a microscope. A microscope makes things look a lot bigger; it lets you see things you can't see just with your eyes. Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water. He saw and drew pictures of the small living things -- he called them \"microbes\" or \"germs\"-- that crowded in a drop of water.\nOne day a winemaker came into the lab, hoping that someone could help him with his problem. \"Sometimes my wine tastes delicious, but sometimes terrible,\" he said to Pasteur. \"Can you help me find out why?\"\nPasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope. He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.\nPasteur's idea worked for other people, too. When farmers heated milk, it didn't turn bad so quickly. When breweries heated beer, it tasted better. People called it \"pasteurization\" ---heating a liquid to kill bad germs. Aren't you glad that the milk you drink has been pasteurized?", "question": "What does the passage mainly tell us?", "choices": ["What life Louis Pasteur lived.", "How to make milk clean.", "How pasteurization was invented.", "What to do with wine."], "answer": 2, "label": "MUL"}
