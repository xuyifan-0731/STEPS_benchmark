One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.

The graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line that passes through each of the points given in the table. From the table, one can see that an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$; for example, $f 2)-f(1)=1-(-2)=3$. Therefore, the graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line with slope 3. Only choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is a line with slope 3. The $y$-intercept of the line is the value of $f(0)$. Since an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$, it follows that $f 1)-f(0)=3$. Since $f(1)=-2$, it follows that $f(0)=f(1)-3=-5$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of the graph of $f(n)$ is -5 , and the equation in slope-intercept form that defined $f$ is $f(n)=3 n-5$.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each equation has the incorrect slope of the line (the $y$-intercept in each equation is also incorrect)."}, "choices": ["$f(n)=n-3$", "$f(n)=2 n-4$", "$f(n)=3 n-5$", "$f(n)=4 n-6$"], "answer": "C", "source": "sat-math.jsonl"}
