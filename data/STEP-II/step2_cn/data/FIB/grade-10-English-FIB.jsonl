Older people who are depressed may have more physical troubles and may pay more attention to them. Depression may result from early memory loss and meanwhile,depression will make a person forget more and faster. A patient with early memory loss and depression really needs to be treated for the depression to slow the memory loss. A mood change is also a sign of depression. If a previously calm person becomes increasingly annoyed,or a previously clean person no longer bothers to shower or clean up,that person should be considered. Don’t tell older adults that you think they may be depressed,as older adults---particularly men–see depression as a weakness. What you should do is tell them you’re worried about their health. Tell them they seem to be out of sorts. Say you just want to check with the doctor to see what’s going on. Once you’ve used physical symptoms to get that person to agree to a check-up,mention your fear to the doctor and allow the doctor to approach the subject of depression with the patient.", "type": "阅读表达", "grade": "高一", "course": "英语", "difficulty": "困难", "label": "QA"}
